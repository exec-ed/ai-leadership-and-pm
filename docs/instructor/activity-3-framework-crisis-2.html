<h1>CRISIS #2: TEAM RESISTANCE</h1>
<section id="detailed-framework-walkthrough-for-facilitators" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="detailed-framework-walkthrough-for-facilitators">Detailed Framework Walkthrough for Facilitators</h2>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This guide shows how to apply the <strong>Crisis Response Framework (Diagnose → Decide → Communicate → Document)</strong> to Crisis #2: Team Resistance. This is a PEOPLE crisis, not a technical crisis—so the framework plays out very differently than Crisis #1.</p>

<section id="the-scenario-quick-recap" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-scenario-quick-recap">THE SCENARIO (Quick Recap)</h2>
<p><strong>Week 2 of Live Pilot (after data fix):</strong> - AI chatbot is now working correctly (data issue fixed) - But: Sarah, your star agent (8 years tenure), is actively discouraging team from using it - Sarah’s stated reason: “AI can’t handle the nuance of our job” - Sarah’s real reason (hidden): Fear of job replacement - Result: 3 of 5 volunteer agents have stopped using the AI suggestions - Your customer service manager warns: “If you push this, you’ll have a revolt. Sarah’s got political capital here.” - <strong>Time to handle this:</strong> 30 minutes</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-difference-people-crisis-vs.-technical-crisis">KEY DIFFERENCE: PEOPLE CRISIS vs.&nbsp;TECHNICAL CRISIS</h2>
<p><strong>Crisis #1 (Data Quality):</strong> - Problem = Data corruption - Solution = Fix the data - Framework focus = Fast diagnosis + clear decision</p>
<p><strong>Crisis #2 (Team Resistance):</strong> - Problem = People don’t trust the system (or fear replacement) - Solution = Address the fear, restore agency, rebuild trust - Framework focus = Deep listening + conversation + involvement</p>
<p><strong>The big insight:</strong> You can’t “decide” people into adoption. You have to <em>engage</em> them.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1-diagnose-5-10-minutes">STEP 1: DIAGNOSE (5-10 minutes)</h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Move beyond the surface complaint (“AI doesn’t work”) to understand the real concern (fear of job loss, autonomy, trust).</p>
<p><strong>This is the hardest step in a people crisis because the real problem is hidden.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Your role as facilitator:</strong> - “Notice: Sarah isn’t saying ‘I fear job loss.’ She’s saying ‘AI doesn’t work.’ But are those the same thing?” - “How would you find out what she’s REALLY worried about?”</p>
<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> In a people crisis, the stated objection is rarely the real problem.</p>

<section id="b.-who-is-sarah-and-why-does-she-matter" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b.-who-is-sarah-and-why-does-she-matter">B. Who Is Sarah and Why Does She Matter?</h3>
<p><strong>Ask the group:</strong> &gt; “Why is Sarah’s resistance a crisis? Why not just ignore her?”</p>
<p><strong>Guide them to understand:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Political capital:</strong> 8 years tenure = respect and trust from team</li>
<li><strong>Influence:</strong> If Sarah says don’t use it, others won’t</li>
<li><strong>Expertise:</strong> She knows customer service inside and out—could spot real issues</li>
<li><strong>Credibility:</strong> Team believes her more than they believe leadership</li>
<li><strong>Power:</strong> She doesn’t have formal authority, but she has informal power (people listen to her)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your role:</strong> - “So if you sideline Sarah, what happens to the team’s adoption?” - “If you fire her, what message does that send to everyone else thinking about resisting?”</p>
<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> In a people crisis, the person resisting often has legitimate power and influence. Going around them makes it worse.</p>

<section id="c.-whats-really-happening" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="c.-whats-really-happening">C. What’s Really Happening?</h3>
<p><strong>Ask the group:</strong> &gt; “Let’s diagnose the real situation. What is Sarah actually afraid of?”</p>
<p><strong>Guide them through the fear diagnosis:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fear #1: Job Loss</strong> - “If AI does what I do, do I get fired?” - “Will I have a job in 5 years?” - “Is this the beginning of outsourcing?”</p>
<p><strong>Fear #2: Loss of Autonomy</strong> - “Why wasn’t I consulted on this?” - “Why is leadership forcing this on me without asking?” - “Do they respect me and my expertise?”</p>
<p><strong>Fear #3: Loss of Identity</strong> - “My identity is being a great customer service agent.” - “If AI does my job, who am I?” - “What’s my value if I’m not needed?”</p>
<p><strong>Your role:</strong> - “Which of these fears do you think is driving Sarah?” - “Have you asked her directly? Or are you guessing?”</p>
<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> You can’t solve a problem you haven’t diagnosed. And you can’t diagnose a people problem without talking to the person.</p>

<section id="d.-whats-the-scope-of-this-problem" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="d.-whats-the-scope-of-this-problem">D. What’s the Scope of This Problem?</h3>
<p><strong>Ask the group:</strong> &gt; “3 of 5 agents stopped using the AI. Is this just Sarah’s influence or is there a bigger team issue?”</p>
<p><strong>Guide them to recognize:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small scope:</strong> Sarah is the only one who feels this way; others are just following her lead</li>
<li><strong>Medium scope:</strong> Sarah articulated a fear everyone has, but they were too afraid to say it</li>
<li><strong>Large scope:</strong> This reflects a deeper trust issue between leadership and the team</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to tell:</strong> - If you remove Sarah, do the others use the AI? → Small scope - If you address Sarah’s fears, do others feel reassured? → Medium scope - If you address Sarah’s fears and people STILL resist? → Large scope (trust issue with leadership)</p>
<p><strong>Your role:</strong> - “What would you ask the team to find out the real scope?” - “Do you need to talk to everyone or just Sarah?”</p>
<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Sometimes one person (Sarah) is the lightning rod for a broader team concern. Fixing Sarah alone won’t solve the problem if the whole team is scared.</p>
<hr>

<section id="e.-diagnose-summary" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="e.-diagnose-summary">E. Diagnose Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Guide them to summarize:</strong> &gt; “So what’s our diagnosis? What’s the real problem we’re solving?”</p>
<p><strong>Expected answer:</strong> - <strong>Surface problem:</strong> Sarah is discouraging team from using AI - <strong>Root cause:</strong> Fear of job replacement + loss of autonomy + possible broken trust with leadership - <strong>Scope:</strong> 3 agents currently resisting, but likely reflects broader team concerns - <strong>Key insight:</strong> We can’t force adoption. We have to address the fear and restore agency.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2-decide-5-15-minutes">STEP 2: DECIDE (5-15 minutes)</h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Choose between different approaches to engaging Sarah and the team. This is NOT a technical decision—it’s a people decision.</p>
<p><strong>Critical: This crisis has no “right answer” that everyone will like. Different choices have very different consequences.</strong></p>
<hr>
<section id="a.-what-are-your-options" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-what-are-your-options">A. What Are Your Options?</h3>
<p><strong>Ask the group:</strong> &gt; “You have a team member actively resisting and influencing others. What are the possible ways to respond?”</p>
<p><strong>Push them to brainstorm ALL options, including ones they don’t like:</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Option A: LISTEN &amp; ENGAGE</strong> (Recommended Staff Model) - Have private conversation with Sarah: “What’s your real concern?” - Listen without defending or justifying - Acknowledge her fear is legitimate - Invite her into decision-making: “Help me design how we do this” - Offer agency: “You have veto power over scope, timeline, approach” - Follow up with team meeting where Sarah helps lead adoption</p>
<p><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> - <strong>Pro:</strong> Addresses root cause. Sarah becomes ally instead of resister. Team sees leadership respects concerns. - <strong>Con:</strong> Takes time. Requires vulnerability from leadership. Might not work if Sarah is just contrarian.</p>
<p><strong>When to choose:</strong> When you believe Sarah’s concern is legitimate (it is—job changes ARE scary) and you want real adoption, not compliance.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Option B: SIDELINE SARAH</strong> (Not Recommended) - Acknowledge her concerns but proceed without her - Focus on the 2 agents who are still on board - Reduce her role in implementation - Wait for natural turnover to solve the “Sarah problem”</p>
<p><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> - <strong>Pro:</strong> Faster. Don’t have to have uncomfortable conversations. Moves project forward. - <strong>Con:</strong> Sarah becomes a martyr. Team sees leadership doesn’t respect dissent. Adoption will be half-hearted at best. High risk of total project failure.</p>
<p><strong>When to choose:</strong> Only if Sarah’s concern is illegitimate (it’s not). This usually backfires.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Option C: FIRE SARAH</strong> (Nuclear Option—Not Recommended) - Make it clear: “You’re either on board or out” - If she refuses, remove her from the pilot - Replace her with someone more cooperative</p>
<p><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> - <strong>Pro:</strong> Removes resistance. Sends a message: “Resist and you’re out” - <strong>Con:</strong> CATASTROPHIC for adoption. Team sees leadership doesn’t respect tenure or concerns. Everyone goes silent (but doesn’t cooperate). Creates resentment. Basically guarantees project failure long-term.</p>
<p><strong>When to choose:</strong> Never, in this scenario. This is losing the war to win a battle.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Option D: PAUSE &amp; REDESIGN</strong> (Compromise Option) - Accept that the current scope (30% of queries) is causing fear - Work WITH Sarah to redesign what AI handles - Maybe reduce scope to safest queries only - Take time to rebuild trust - Restart with Sarah as partner, not resister</p>
<p><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> - <strong>Pro:</strong> Addresses the fear by reducing risk. Builds real partnership. Slower rollout but higher adoption. - <strong>Con:</strong> Delays project. Requires admitting current approach had issues. Might feel like “giving in” to resistance.</p>
<p><strong>When to choose:</strong> If you discover the resistance is legitimate (e.g., “AI can’t actually handle these queries safely”).</p>

<p><strong>Your role as facilitator:</strong> - “Notice the pattern: Speed and team trust are inversely related. You can have fast OR trusted. Pick one.” - “Which approach do you think a great leader chooses?”</p>
<p><strong>Staff model:</strong> “Most great leaders choose Option A (Listen &amp; Engage). Yes, it takes 2 weeks. But those 2 weeks buy you 12 months of team adoption instead of 12 months of covert resistance.”</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="c.-make-the-decision" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="c.-make-the-decision">C. Make the Decision</h3>
<p><strong>Ask the group:</strong> &gt; “Based on this analysis, what’s your recommendation? What are you going to do with Sarah?”</p>
<p><strong>Staff Model Answer (Excellent Leadership):</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“We choose <strong>Listen &amp; Engage</strong>. Here’s why:</p>
<p>Sarah’s concern is legitimate. Yes, AI changes her role. Yes, that’s scary. That’s not weakness—that’s normal.</p>
<p>If we sideline her or fire her, the rest of the team will nod along but secretly resist. We lose adoption and credibility.</p>
<p>If we listen to her, acknowledge her fear, and give her a voice in how we implement this, she often becomes our best advocate. She’s respected. If she says ‘I was skeptical, but here’s why I think this works now,’ the whole team follows.</p>
<p>Yes, it takes 2 weeks. But 2 weeks of engagement now beats 12 weeks of covert resistance later.”</p>
</blockquote>

<section id="d.-what-about-the-boundary" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="d.-what-about-the-boundary">D. What About the Boundary?</h3>
<p><strong>This is important: Listening ≠ Accepting Refusal</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ask the group:</strong> &gt; “If Sarah still refuses after you’ve listened, what do you do? Do you let her veto the project?”</p>
<p><strong>Staff Model:</strong> &gt; “No.&nbsp;Here’s how you set the boundary AFTER you’ve listened: &gt; &gt; ‘Sarah, I hear you. I’ve listened to your concerns. Here’s what I’m not comfortable with: I won’t let one person block a project the rest of the team wants to try. Here’s what I AM doing: [Your decision, incorporating her feedback where possible]. &gt; &gt; You can participate in making this work, or you can sit it out. But the project moves. What do you want to do?’ &gt; &gt; But here’s the key: You only set this boundary AFTER you’ve genuinely listened. If you set it first, you’ve just confirmed her fear that leadership doesn’t respect her.”</p>
<p><strong>Your role:</strong> - “Notice the sequence: Listen first, boundary second. Not boundary first, listen later.”</p>
<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Respecting someone’s concern doesn’t mean giving them veto power. It means listening, understanding, and then deciding together.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="e.-decision-summary" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="e.-decision-summary">E. Decision Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Guide them to write down:</strong> &gt; “Our decision: [OPTION]. We’re choosing this because [REASONING]. Here’s how we handle Sarah specifically, and here’s our boundary if she refuses.”</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> &gt; “Our decision: Listen &amp; Engage. We’re meeting with Sarah privately to understand her real concern (which is probably job security). We acknowledge it’s legitimate. We invite her to help design how we implement this. We give her a voice. If she still refuses to cooperate after that, we set a clear boundary: ‘We’re moving forward. You can be part of the solution or sit it out, but the project continues.’”</p>

<section id="step-3-communicate-10-30-minutes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-3-communicate-10-30-minutes">STEP 3: COMMUNICATE (10-30 minutes)</h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Have the right conversation with Sarah, then with the team. This is THE critical step in a people crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> The conversation with Sarah is more important than any announcement. If you get this wrong, everything else fails.</p>
<hr>
<section id="a.-private-conversation-with-sarah" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-private-conversation-with-sarah">A. PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH SARAH</h3>
<p><strong>WHO:</strong> Sarah alone (not public, not with her boss present—that’s threatening)</p>
<p><strong>WHEN:</strong> Within 24 hours of noticing resistance</p>
<p><strong>YOUR OPENING (not defensive):</strong> &gt; “Sarah, I noticed you’ve been skeptical about the AI, and I want to understand why. Your feedback matters to me because you’ve got 8 years of experience here and you care about this team. What’s your real concern?”</p>
<p><strong>Then LISTEN.</strong> Don’t interrupt. Don’t defend. Just listen.</p>
<p><strong>What you might hear:</strong> - “I think AI is going to replace me” - “I’m not sure the AI can really do this” - “Leadership never listens to us anyway” - “I’ve seen failed projects before”</p>
<p><strong>Your next move (ACKNOWLEDGE, don’t dismiss):</strong> &gt; “That’s a legitimate concern. Let me be straight with you: [ADDRESS THE FEAR]”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>IF it’s job loss fear:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I hear you. Let me be clear: We’re not replacing anyone. The questions asking ‘Where’s my order?’—anyone can answer that in 2 minutes. You’re the expert on the angry customers, the complex problems, the exceptions.</p>
<p>AI handles the repetitive stuff so YOU can do the work only you can do. And honestly? The work only you can do is more interesting.</p>
<p>In 2 years, I think you could be managing a team instead of answering routine questions. Does that future sound interesting to you?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> - You didn’t say “Don’t worry, you won’t be replaced” - You reframed her job as MORE valuable in the future, not less - You offered a vision where her expertise becomes more important - You made it specific (managing a team) not vague (we’ll find something)</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>IF it’s technical concern (AI really can’t do this):</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“You’re right—AI can’t handle everything. That’s why we’re limiting scope. It’s handling order tracking and return policy questions, not complaints or exceptions. Those stay with you.</p>
<p>I’ve seen the accuracy data; it’s solid for routine stuff. I’m asking for 4 more weeks to prove it. If at the end of 4 weeks you’re still skeptical, we have a real conversation about whether to keep going. You help me decide. Deal?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> - You validated her technical concern (don’t dismiss it) - You clarified the scope (makes it less threatening) - You invited her to be the judge (gave her agency) - You set a clear timeline (not “forever”)</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>IF it’s trust/autonomy issue:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I know we’ve asked a lot of you without always asking for your input first. That’s fair criticism. Here’s what I’m committing to going forward:</p>
<p>Weekly check-ins where we review the AI performance data together. You see the numbers, you help me interpret them. If you spot problems, we listen. You’re not just affected by this project—you’re steering it.</p>
<p>I want your expertise in the room. Not just as feedback, but as actual decision-making. Deal?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> - You acknowledged the past dynamic (didn’t excuse it) - You made a specific commitment (weekly check-ins, not vague promises) - You offered real agency (you help decide, not just complain) - You positioned her as valuable, not as the problem</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b.-after-the-conversation-with-sarah">B. AFTER THE CONVERSATION WITH SARAH</h3>
<p><strong>Regardless of what she said, here’s what you do next:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Make her an offer:</strong> &gt; “Would you be willing to help me understand how we implement this in a way that works for the team? I’d rather have you designing this WITH me than me imposing it ON you.”</p>
<p><strong>If she says yes:</strong> Great. She’s now an ally. Go to Step 3C (Team Meeting).</p>
<p><strong>If she says no:</strong> You set a boundary. &gt; “I respect that. Here’s where I’m at: We’re moving forward with the pilot. I’d rather have you on board, but I understand you have reservations. You can participate in making this work, or you can step back. But the project continues. What do you want to do?”</p>
<p><strong>Then you follow through.</strong> If she stays, you continue engagement. If she steps back, you accept that and move on with the rest of the team.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="c.-team-meeting-with-sarah-ideally-present">C. TEAM MEETING (with Sarah ideally present)</h3>
<p><strong>WHO:</strong> Full customer service team</p>
<p><strong>WHEN:</strong> Within 2 days of talking to Sarah</p>
<p><strong>YOUR OPENING:</strong> &gt; “I want to address the elephant in the room. Some of you are concerned about the AI. Those concerns are legitimate. Let me be direct about what’s happening.”</p>
<p><strong>Then deliver the four key messages:</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Message #1: You’re not being replaced</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“If I wanted to replace you, I could hire a call centre in India for 1/3 your cost. I didn’t. You’re here because you’re good at this job. And I need you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Direct answer to the fear everyone’s thinking. Specific (India, cost). Shows you’ve thought about it.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Message #2: AI has a narrow scope</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“AI is handling specific routine queries. Order tracking. Policy questions. Things that don’t require judgment. Not complaints. Not exceptions. Not things that need empathy. YOU handle all the hard stuff. AI handles the repetitive stuff.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Makes it concrete. Reduces the threat (“it’s not doing MY job, it’s doing the routine stuff”).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Message #3: You decide if it stays</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Here’s what I’m NOT doing: Forcing this on you. Here’s what I AM doing: Running a 4-week pilot. At the end, we evaluate together. Is this actually helping? Does it free you up for harder work? Does it work as promised? If the answer is no, we stop. You have veto power here.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Restores agency. They’re not victims of the decision—they’re judges of whether it works. That’s powerful.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Message #4: Your role is changing—for the better</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Yes, your role is changing. But not because AI is replacing you. Because we’re using AI to remove the boring, repetitive stuff so you can do work that’s more interesting and uses your actual skills. I think that’s better. What do you think?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Reframes change from threat to improvement. Appeals to desire to do meaningful work.</p>
<hr>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“What I need from you: Honest feedback. If AI is screwing up, tell me. If it’s working, tell me that. Sarah especially—you’ve got great instincts about this team. I want you leading this feedback process.”</p>

<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> You’ve just made Sarah the FEEDBACK LEADER, not the resistance leader. You’ve given her a leadership role in the pilot. This often turns skeptics into advocates.</p>

<p>“Who did we talk to, in what order, and what did we say?”</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 1. <strong>Sarah alone</strong> (private, listening-focused) → Understand her fear, acknowledge it, offer partnership 2. <strong>Team meeting</strong> (with Sarah, if possible as partner) → Explain what’s happening, address fears, offer agency</p>

<pre><code>TEAM RESISTANCE INCIDENT

Date: Week 2 of Pilot
Who Resisted: Sarah, star agent (8 years tenure)
Stated Objection: "AI can't handle the nuance of our job"

<p><strong>What to record:</strong> - <strong>Why did Sarah resist?</strong> She felt threatened and hadn’t been consulted - <strong>Why didn’t we anticipate this?</strong> We didn’t involve skeptics in design - <strong>What could we have done differently?</strong> Get Sarah in the room BEFORE the pilot, not after - <strong>What does this tell us about change?</strong> People resist change they don’t understand or control</p>
<p><strong>Document template:</strong></p>
<pre><code>ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

Immediate Cause: Sarah feared job replacement and had no voice in decision
Deeper Cause: We designed the pilot without involving the team
Systemic Cause: We treated adoption as a "tell people about it" problem, not a "involve them in it" problem

Prevention: For next projects, involve skeptics in design phase, not just volunteers</code></pre>

<p><strong>What to record:</strong> - <strong>Decision:</strong> Listen &amp; Engage approach - <strong>Why this option:</strong> Addresses root cause (fear + powerlessness) instead of symptoms - <strong>What we committed to:</strong> Private conversation with Sarah, team meeting, weekly check-ins - <strong>Alternative options considered:</strong> Sideline, fire, pause &amp; redesign (and why they would fail)</p>
<p><strong>Document template:</strong></p>
<pre><code>DECISION MADE:

Approach: Listen &amp; Engage
Timeline: 2 weeks of intensive engagement + ongoing weekly check-ins
Key Actions:
1. Private conversation with Sarah (within 24 hours)
2. Acknowledge her fear is legitimate
3. Invite her to help design implementation
4. Team meeting: reframe change, restore agency, make her feedback leader
5. Weekly check-ins with Sarah + team

Alternative Approaches Considered:
- Sideline Sarah: Would create martyr, destroy team trust, backfire
- Fire Sarah: Would confirm everyone's fears, destroy adoption, catastrophic
- Pause &amp; Redesign: Valid if we discover AI scope is actually too broad</code></pre>

<section id="e.-the-learning" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="e.-the-learning">E. The Learning</h3>
<p><strong>What to record for future projects:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Learning #1: Stated Objection ≠ Real Concern</strong> - “AI can’t do this work” masks “I’m scared of job loss” - Different solutions for surface problem vs.&nbsp;root problem - Ask good questions to diagnose the real fear</p>
<p><strong>Learning #2: Involvement Beats Announcement</strong> - Telling people about change = low adoption - Involving people in design = high adoption - Get skeptics in the room EARLY, not as a crisis response</p>
<p><strong>Learning #3: Agency Restores Trust</strong> - People resist when they feel powerless - People cooperate when they have a voice in decisions - Give people veto power over scope, timeline, approach</p>
<p><strong>Learning #4: Leadership = Listening First, Deciding Second</strong> - You can’t shortcut conversation by just announcing decisions - Spending time listening now saves time fighting resistance later - Respect ≠ agreement. You can respect someone’s concern and still overrule them</p>
<p><strong>Document template:</strong></p>
<pre><code>LEARNING FOR FUTURE PROJECTS:

1. Always distinguish between STATED OBJECTION and REAL CONCERN
   - Spend time listening to uncover what people are really worried about
   - Different diagnosis = different solution

2. INVOLVE SKEPTICS EARLY
   - Don't just invite volunteers for pilots
   - Actively bring in the people who are skeptical
   - Their concerns make the project better, not worse

3. RESTORATION OF AGENCY
   - When people feel powerless, they resist
   - When people have a voice, they cooperate
   - Make them judges of whether it works, not just subjects of the change

4. LISTENING AS LEADERSHIP TOOL
   - The conversation is the intervention
   - Time spent in genuine listening saves time fighting covert resistance
   - Respect people's concerns even if you don't agree with them

PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS:
- Add "stakeholder resistance analysis" to project planning
- Involve skeptics in design phase
- Build in "voice and choice" for affected teams
- Regular check-ins with team feedback
- Document what people worried about and how you addressed it</code></pre>

<p><strong>During the simulation, watch for:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Good signs:</strong> - Group recognizes Sarah’s fear is legitimate (not just “she’s being difficult”) - Plan to listen to Sarah before announcing to team - Willingness to give her a role in the solution - Understanding that this takes time</p>
<p><strong>Red flags:</strong> - “Let’s just move forward without Sarah” - “She’s being irrational, we should fire her” - “We’ll announce the decision and she’ll fall in line” - No plan for how to engage the rest of the team</p>
<p><strong>If group gets stuck:</strong> - “What would you want if you’d been in this job 8 years and suddenly there’s AI?” - “Why does leadership listening matter more than leadership being right?” - “How do you get adoption without involvement?”</p>
<p><strong>After their presentation, use the debrief questions to pull out learning about:</strong> - Distinguishing stated objection from real concern - The power of listening in leadership - How one influential person can impact a whole team - Prevention (involve skeptics early, not as crisis response)</p>
