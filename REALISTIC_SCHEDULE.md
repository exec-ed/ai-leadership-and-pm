## CRITICAL TIMING NOTES

**What can flex:**
- Icebreaker: Can shorten to 5 min if running late
- Exercise 2: Can shorten to 50 min (still works)
- Exercise 4: Can shorten to 30 min (2 cases instead of 3)
- Final Q&A: Can shorten to 10 min

**What CANNOT flex:**
- Exercise 1: Need full 45 min for all 6 stakeholder rotations
- Exercise 3: Need at least 60 min (3 crises minimum)
- Lunch: People need to eat
- Breaks: People need breaks

**If you're running behind:**
1. Shorten final Q&A (3:50-4:15 becomes 3:50-4:05)
2. Shorten Exercise 4 to 2 cases (saves 10 min)
3. Tighten Exercise 2 debrief (saves 5 min)
4. Skip icebreaker stories, just dive in (saves 10 min)

**Never skip:**
- Exercise 1 (Stakeholder) - core learning
- Exercise 3 (Crisis) - core learning
- Breaks - people shut down without them

## PRINT THIS AND USE IT ON THE DAY

Put times in the left margin, check them off as you go. If you hit 11:30 and you're still on Exercise 1, you know you need to speed up Exercise 2.
