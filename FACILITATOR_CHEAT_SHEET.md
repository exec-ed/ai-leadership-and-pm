## Exercise 1: Stakeholder Speed Dating (9:30-10:15)

**Setup:** 6 roles rotate every 5 minutes
**Roles:** Data Scientist, Operations Manager, End User, IT Security, Finance, Executive Sponsor

**Instructions:**
1. Give each participant a role card
2. "You're this stakeholder for the next 5 minutes. Talk about your concerns about this AI project."
3. Every 5 minutes, rotate to new role
4. After all 6 roles: "What surprised you? Who's hardest to manage?"

**Handout:** `handouts/stakeholder-mapping-template.md`

---

## Exercise 2: Pilot Scoping (10:30-11:30)

**Setup:** Divide into groups, half get budget cut, half get timeline acceleration
**Case:** Customer service AI chatbot for RetailFlow

**Instructions:**
1. Read `activities/materials/case-briefs/pilot_scoping_case.md` together
2. Groups design pilot scope (what to include, metrics, timeline)
3. Add constraint card halfway through
4. Groups present their scope
5. Debrief: "There's no perfect answer - show the trade-offs"

**Key Point:** Goldilocks principle - not too big, not too small

---

## Exercise 3: Crisis Simulation (1:15-2:35)

**Setup:** 4 crises, 20 minutes each
**Context:** RetailFlow chatbot project (see `handouts/company-overview.md`)

**Crisis 1 - Data Quality (20 min):**
- Model accuracy drops 85% â†’ 62%
- Groups diagnose root cause from data logs
- Decide: How to communicate? Fix or pause?

**Crisis 2 - Staff Resistance (20 min):**
- Customer service reps sabotaging AI
- You role-play as resistant employee
- Groups practice stakeholder management

**Crisis 3 - Executive Pressure (20 min):**
- CEO demands accelerated rollout
- You role-play as demanding CEO
- Groups practice managing up

**Crisis 4 - Ethical Dilemma (20 min):**
- AI bias detected against certain customers
- Groups apply ethical framework
- Decision: Disclose? Fix first? How?

**Handout:** `handouts/ethical-decision-framework.md`

---

## Exercise 4: Scale or Kill (2:50-3:35)

**Setup:** 3 case studies - success, failure, ambiguous
**Framework:** Scale / Pivot / Kill decision matrix

**Instructions:**
1. Read `handouts/scale-pivot-kill-matrix.md`
2. Apply to 3 cases
3. Groups vote: Scale, Pivot, or Kill for each
4. Discuss: "What criteria mattered most?"

**Key Point:** Most AI projects should pivot or kill - that's success, not failure

---

## Debrief Questions (3:35-4:15)

1. "What was your biggest 'aha' moment today?"
2. "Which exercise was most challenging? Why?"
3. "What will you do differently on Monday with your AI project?"
4. "What framework will you use first?"

---

## Handouts to Give Participants

## Facilitation Tips (from facilitator-notes.md)

**General:**
- Let participants struggle a bit - that's where learning happens
- No "right" answers - AI leadership is about trade-offs
- Call on quiet people: "Sarah, what would you do?"

**Exercise 1 (Stakeholder):**
- Energy is key - make it fast-paced
- Point out: "Notice how Finance sees this totally differently than Data Science?"

**Exercise 2 (Pilot):**
- Don't let groups spend 20 minutes on metrics
- Push them: "You have 3 months and $50K - what's in, what's out?"

**Exercise 3 (Crisis):**
- Be dramatic when role-playing resistant employee or demanding CEO
- Real crises feel chaotic - that's the point

**Exercise 4 (Scale/Kill):**
- Challenge their reasoning: "But what if...?"
- Normalize killing projects: "That's good leadership, not failure"

## If You Run Out of Time

**Priority order:**
1. Exercise 1 (Stakeholder) - DO NOT SKIP
2. Exercise 3 (Crisis) - DO NOT SKIP, but can shorten to 2-3 crises
3. Exercise 2 (Pilot) - Can shorten to 45 min
4. Exercise 4 (Scale/Kill) - Can skip if desperate, give matrix as handout
