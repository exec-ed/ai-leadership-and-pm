## KEY FACILITATION MOVES

### Before Each Activity
1. Set expectations: "You have X minutes. Here's what success looks like."
2. Give clear instructions: Hand out worksheet, read scenario aloud once
3. Set timer: Make it visible so groups self-manage time
4. Don't answer questions: Ask back: "What's your thinking on that?"

### During Debrief
1. **Ask open question** (not leading) → Listen to 2-3 answers → Highlight insight → Connect to real work
2. **3-question debrief minimum**, up to 5
3. **End with one clear learning point** (refer to the specific activity guide's debrief section)

### Throughout the Day
- Celebrate good thinking ("You're thinking like a PM")
- Validate concerns ("That's a legitimate worry")
- Push constraint thinking ("What would you cut?")
- Notice values-based decisions ("You chose integrity over metrics")

---

## COMMON FACILITATION CHALLENGES

### Challenge: Group asks "What's the right answer?"
**Response:** "There isn't one. Show me your thinking. Better reasoning beats a 'right' answer you can't explain."

### Challenge: Someone finishes early
**Response:** "Add a constraint. Your budget just got cut in half. What changes?"

### Challenge: Group is really stuck
**Response:** "You have 5 minutes left. Make a decision with what you have. Perfect is the enemy of done."

### Challenge: Running out of time
**Response:** Shorten debrief to 10 min. Hit the key learning point and move on. Don't skip debrief entirely.

### Challenge: Someone gets emotional/frustrated
**Response:** "This is hitting something real for you. That's actually good—it means you care about getting it right."

---

## QUICK DEBRIEF FLOWS

### 3-Minute Debrief (If Running Very Short on Time)
1. Ask one question (1 min)
2. Listen to 1-2 answers (1 min)
3. Land the learning (1 min): "Here's why this matters..."

### 10-Minute Debrief (Standard)
1. Gallery walk or quick present (3 min)
2. Ask 2-3 discussion questions (5 min)
3. Land learning + transition (2 min)

### 20-Minute Debrief (Full Depth)
1. Gallery walk or present (5 min)
2. Ask 4-5 discussion questions with follow-ups (10 min)
3. Synthesize + land key point (5 min)

---

## ASSESSMENT: WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### Strong Performance
- ✓ Limits scope (doesn't try to do everything)
- ✓ Defines clear success metrics
- ✓ Identifies 5+ risks with mitigation
- ✓ Maps all major stakeholders
- ✓ Makes decisions with clear rationale
- ✓ Considers ethical dimensions
- ✓ Asks thoughtful questions in debrief

### Areas for Development
- ~ Scope is reasonable but not well-justified
- ~ Metrics defined but somewhat vague
- ~ Identifies 3-4 risks but mitigation is generic
- ~ Maps main stakeholders but misses some
- ~ Makes decisions without clear reasoning
- ~ Ignores ethical/values dimensions

---

## IF YOU'RE SHORT ON TIME

**Cut in this order:**
1. **Keep:** Lecture + Pilot Scoping + Debrief
2. **Keep:** Crisis #1-2 + Debrief (drop #3-4)
3. **Keep:** Scale/Pivot/Kill
4. **Cut:** Speed-Dating (good but optional)
5. **Cut:** Action Planning (summarize instead)

**Still keeps core skills:** Scoping, crisis management, decision-making

---

## IF YOU HAVE EXTRA TIME

**Add in this order:**
1. Real case study: "This actually happened at [your company]"
2. Guest speaker: Real PM who's led AI projects
3. Second Speed-Dating round: Different stakeholders
4. Group competition: "Best scale-up plan" with voting
5. Extended Action Planning: Participants present their plans

## NOTES FOR VIRTUAL/HYBRID DELIVERY

### Virtual (Zoom/Teams)
- Use breakout rooms for group work
- Shorter debrief time (10 min instead of 20)
- Designate someone to be scribe (everyone sees work in real-time)
- Share screen with your notes/key points
- Chat polls for quick feedback

### Hybrid (Some In-Person, Some Remote)
- Remote folks in one breakout room
- In-person folks in physical room
- Use shared doc/board so both sides see progress
- Debrief in main room (everyone together)
- Smaller breakout groups = faster work

### Asynchronous (If Recording/Async Delivery)
- Record you explaining each exercise
- Have participants work independently
- Provide staff answers so they can self-check
- Debrief via recorded feedback or discussion forum

---

## FOR FUTURE ITERATIONS

### After Each Delivery, Note:
- Which debrief questions landed best?
- Which activities took longer than expected?
- What surprised participants?
- What real-world examples resonated?
- What would you change next time?

### Customize for Your Organization:
- Replace RetailFlow scenario with real case from your company
- Use your actual stakeholder roles (might differ from sample)
- Reference your real AI projects in examples
- Invite colleagues who've led AI projects to share stories

## SUPPORT DOCUMENTS

These materials assume you have:
- **Your lecture slides** (Foundations & Frameworks)
- **Pilot Scoping worksheet** (template in activities folder)
- **Crisis scenario cards** (4 cards, given one at a time)
- **Scale/Pivot/Kill criteria sheet** (template in activities folder)

All scenario details are in the **main masterclass materials** (_archive/ folder).

---

## REMEMBER

**Your job is not to have all the answers.** Your job is to:
- Create space for hard thinking
- Ask good questions
- Celebrate good reasoning
- Connect exercises to real work
- Give people permission to make hard decisions

**The exercises do the heavy lifting. Trust them.**

If something in here is unclear:
1. Check the specific activity guide for detailed staff answers and debrief guidance (1_pilot_scoping_exercise.md, 2_crisis_management_simulation.md, etc.)
2. Check facilitator-quick-reference-master.md for practical tips and facilitation moves
3. Trust your instincts (you know your audience)

Good luck. This is important work.
