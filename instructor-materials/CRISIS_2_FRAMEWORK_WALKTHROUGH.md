# CRISIS #2: TEAM RESISTANCE
## Detailed Framework Walkthrough for Facilitators

**Purpose:** This guide shows how to apply the **Crisis Response Framework (Diagnose → Decide → Communicate → Document)** to Crisis #2: Team Resistance. This is a PEOPLE crisis, not a technical crisis—so the framework plays out very differently than Crisis #1.

---

## THE SCENARIO (Quick Recap)

**Week 2 of Live Pilot (after data fix):**
- AI chatbot is now working correctly (data issue fixed)
- But: Sarah, your star agent (8 years tenure), is actively discouraging team from using it
- Sarah's stated reason: "AI can't handle the nuance of our job"
- Sarah's real reason (hidden): Fear of job replacement
- Result: 3 of 5 volunteer agents have stopped using the AI suggestions
- Your customer service manager warns: "If you push this, you'll have a revolt. Sarah's got political capital here."
- **Time to handle this:** 30 minutes

---

## KEY DIFFERENCE: PEOPLE CRISIS vs. TECHNICAL CRISIS

**Crisis #1 (Data Quality):**
- Problem = Data corruption
- Solution = Fix the data
- Framework focus = Fast diagnosis + clear decision

**Crisis #2 (Team Resistance):**
- Problem = People don't trust the system (or fear replacement)
- Solution = Address the fear, restore agency, rebuild trust
- Framework focus = Deep listening + conversation + involvement

**The big insight:** You can't "decide" people into adoption. You have to *engage* them.

---

---

## FRAMEWORK APPLICATION: DIAGNOSE → DECIDE → COMMUNICATE → DOCUMENT

---

## STEP 1: DIAGNOSE (5-10 minutes)

**Goal:** Move beyond the surface complaint ("AI doesn't work") to understand the real concern (fear of job loss, autonomy, trust).

**This is the hardest step in a people crisis because the real problem is hidden.**

---

### A. What's the Stated Problem vs. the Real Problem?

**Ask the group:**
> "Sarah says 'AI can't handle the nuance of our job.' Is that her real concern or is something else going on?"

**Guide them to recognize:**

| Stated Objection | What It Might Mask | Real Concern |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| "AI can't do what we do" | "I don't trust this will work" | Legitimate technical skepticism |
| "AI can't do what we do" | "You're going to replace me" | Fear of job loss |
| "This is being forced on us" | "I had no say in this decision" | Loss of autonomy/respect |
| "I don't trust it" | "I don't trust leadership" | Broken previous promises |

**Your role as facilitator:**
- "Notice: Sarah isn't saying 'I fear job loss.' She's saying 'AI doesn't work.' But are those the same thing?"
- "How would you find out what she's REALLY worried about?"

**Key insight:** In a people crisis, the stated objection is rarely the real problem.

---

### B. Who Is Sarah and Why Does She Matter?

**Ask the group:**
> "Why is Sarah's resistance a crisis? Why not just ignore her?"

**Guide them to understand:**

- **Political capital:** 8 years tenure = respect and trust from team
- **Influence:** If Sarah says don't use it, others won't
- **Expertise:** She knows customer service inside and out—could spot real issues
- **Credibility:** Team believes her more than they believe leadership
- **Power:** She doesn't have formal authority, but she has informal power (people listen to her)

**Your role:**
- "So if you sideline Sarah, what happens to the team's adoption?"
- "If you fire her, what message does that send to everyone else thinking about resisting?"

**Key insight:** In a people crisis, the person resisting often has legitimate power and influence. Going around them makes it worse.

---

### C. What's Really Happening?

**Ask the group:**
> "Let's diagnose the real situation. What is Sarah actually afraid of?"

**Guide them through the fear diagnosis:**

**Fear #1: Job Loss**
- "If AI does what I do, do I get fired?"
- "Will I have a job in 5 years?"
- "Is this the beginning of outsourcing?"

**Fear #2: Loss of Autonomy**
- "Why wasn't I consulted on this?"
- "Why is leadership forcing this on me without asking?"
- "Do they respect me and my expertise?"

**Fear #3: Loss of Identity**
- "My identity is being a great customer service agent."
- "If AI does my job, who am I?"
- "What's my value if I'm not needed?"

**Your role:**
- "Which of these fears do you think is driving Sarah?"
- "Have you asked her directly? Or are you guessing?"

**Key insight:** You can't solve a problem you haven't diagnosed. And you can't diagnose a people problem without talking to the person.

---

### D. What's the Scope of This Problem?

**Ask the group:**
> "3 of 5 agents stopped using the AI. Is this just Sarah's influence or is there a bigger team issue?"

**Guide them to recognize:**

- **Small scope:** Sarah is the only one who feels this way; others are just following her lead
- **Medium scope:** Sarah articulated a fear everyone has, but they were too afraid to say it
- **Large scope:** This reflects a deeper trust issue between leadership and the team

**How to tell:**
- If you remove Sarah, do the others use the AI? → Small scope
- If you address Sarah's fears, do others feel reassured? → Medium scope
- If you address Sarah's fears and people STILL resist? → Large scope (trust issue with leadership)

**Your role:**
- "What would you ask the team to find out the real scope?"
- "Do you need to talk to everyone or just Sarah?"

**Key insight:** Sometimes one person (Sarah) is the lightning rod for a broader team concern. Fixing Sarah alone won't solve the problem if the whole team is scared.

---

### E. Diagnose Summary

**Guide them to summarize:**
> "So what's our diagnosis? What's the real problem we're solving?"

**Expected answer:**
- **Surface problem:** Sarah is discouraging team from using AI
- **Root cause:** Fear of job replacement + loss of autonomy + possible broken trust with leadership
- **Scope:** 3 agents currently resisting, but likely reflects broader team concerns
- **Key insight:** We can't force adoption. We have to address the fear and restore agency.

---

---

## STEP 2: DECIDE (5-15 minutes)

**Goal:** Choose between different approaches to engaging Sarah and the team. This is NOT a technical decision—it's a people decision.

**Critical: This crisis has no "right answer" that everyone will like. Different choices have very different consequences.**

---

### A. What Are Your Options?

**Ask the group:**
> "You have a team member actively resisting and influencing others. What are the possible ways to respond?"

**Push them to brainstorm ALL options, including ones they don't like:**

---

**Option A: LISTEN & ENGAGE** (Recommended Staff Model)
- Have private conversation with Sarah: "What's your real concern?"
- Listen without defending or justifying
- Acknowledge her fear is legitimate
- Invite her into decision-making: "Help me design how we do this"
- Offer agency: "You have veto power over scope, timeline, approach"
- Follow up with team meeting where Sarah helps lead adoption

**Trade-offs:**
- **Pro:** Addresses root cause. Sarah becomes ally instead of resister. Team sees leadership respects concerns.
- **Con:** Takes time. Requires vulnerability from leadership. Might not work if Sarah is just contrarian.

**When to choose:** When you believe Sarah's concern is legitimate (it is—job changes ARE scary) and you want real adoption, not compliance.

---

**Option B: SIDELINE SARAH** (Not Recommended)
- Acknowledge her concerns but proceed without her
- Focus on the 2 agents who are still on board
- Reduce her role in implementation
- Wait for natural turnover to solve the "Sarah problem"

**Trade-offs:**
- **Pro:** Faster. Don't have to have uncomfortable conversations. Moves project forward.
- **Con:** Sarah becomes a martyr. Team sees leadership doesn't respect dissent. Adoption will be half-hearted at best. High risk of total project failure.

**When to choose:** Only if Sarah's concern is illegitimate (it's not). This usually backfires.

---

**Option C: FIRE SARAH** (Nuclear Option—Not Recommended)
- Make it clear: "You're either on board or out"
- If she refuses, remove her from the pilot
- Replace her with someone more cooperative

**Trade-offs:**
- **Pro:** Removes resistance. Sends a message: "Resist and you're out"
- **Con:** CATASTROPHIC for adoption. Team sees leadership doesn't respect tenure or concerns. Everyone goes silent (but doesn't cooperate). Creates resentment. Basically guarantees project failure long-term.

**When to choose:** Never, in this scenario. This is losing the war to win a battle.

---

**Option D: PAUSE & REDESIGN** (Compromise Option)
- Accept that the current scope (30% of queries) is causing fear
- Work WITH Sarah to redesign what AI handles
- Maybe reduce scope to safest queries only
- Take time to rebuild trust
- Restart with Sarah as partner, not resister

**Trade-offs:**
- **Pro:** Addresses the fear by reducing risk. Builds real partnership. Slower rollout but higher adoption.
- **Con:** Delays project. Requires admitting current approach had issues. Might feel like "giving in" to resistance.

**When to choose:** If you discover the resistance is legitimate (e.g., "AI can't actually handle these queries safely").

---

### B. Evaluate Each Option

**Create a decision matrix:**

| Option | Speed | Adoption | Team Trust | Long-Term Success | Risk |
|--------|-------|----------|------------|-------------------|------|
| **Listen & Engage** | Slow (2 weeks) | High (80%+) | Restored | High | Medium (might not work) |
| **Sideline Sarah** | Fast (immediate) | Low (40%) | Damaged | Low | HIGH (backfires) |
| **Fire Sarah** | Fast (immediate) | Very Low (20%) | Destroyed | Very Low | CATASTROPHIC |
| **Pause & Redesign** | Slow (3 weeks) | High (70%+) | Improved | Medium-High | Medium (depends on redesign) |

**Your role as facilitator:**
- "Notice the pattern: Speed and team trust are inversely related. You can have fast OR trusted. Pick one."
- "Which approach do you think a great leader chooses?"

**Staff model:** "Most great leaders choose Option A (Listen & Engage). Yes, it takes 2 weeks. But those 2 weeks buy you 12 months of team adoption instead of 12 months of covert resistance."

---

### C. Make the Decision

**Ask the group:**
> "Based on this analysis, what's your recommendation? What are you going to do with Sarah?"

**Staff Model Answer (Excellent Leadership):**

> "We choose **Listen & Engage**. Here's why:
>
> Sarah's concern is legitimate. Yes, AI changes her role. Yes, that's scary. That's not weakness—that's normal.
>
> If we sideline her or fire her, the rest of the team will nod along but secretly resist. We lose adoption and credibility.
>
> If we listen to her, acknowledge her fear, and give her a voice in how we implement this, she often becomes our best advocate. She's respected. If she says 'I was skeptical, but here's why I think this works now,' the whole team follows.
>
> Yes, it takes 2 weeks. But 2 weeks of engagement now beats 12 weeks of covert resistance later."

---

### D. What About the Boundary?

**This is important: Listening ≠ Accepting Refusal**

**Ask the group:**
> "If Sarah still refuses after you've listened, what do you do? Do you let her veto the project?"

**Staff Model:**
> "No. Here's how you set the boundary AFTER you've listened:
>
> 'Sarah, I hear you. I've listened to your concerns. Here's what I'm not comfortable with: I won't let one person block a project the rest of the team wants to try. Here's what I AM doing: [Your decision, incorporating her feedback where possible].
>
> You can participate in making this work, or you can sit it out. But the project moves. What do you want to do?'
>
> But here's the key: You only set this boundary AFTER you've genuinely listened. If you set it first, you've just confirmed her fear that leadership doesn't respect her."

**Your role:**
- "Notice the sequence: Listen first, boundary second. Not boundary first, listen later."

**Key insight:** Respecting someone's concern doesn't mean giving them veto power. It means listening, understanding, and then deciding together.

---

### E. Decision Summary

**Guide them to write down:**
> "Our decision: [OPTION]. We're choosing this because [REASONING]. Here's how we handle Sarah specifically, and here's our boundary if she refuses."

**Example:**
> "Our decision: Listen & Engage. We're meeting with Sarah privately to understand her real concern (which is probably job security). We acknowledge it's legitimate. We invite her to help design how we implement this. We give her a voice. If she still refuses to cooperate after that, we set a clear boundary: 'We're moving forward. You can be part of the solution or sit it out, but the project continues.'"

---

---

## STEP 3: COMMUNICATE (10-30 minutes)

**Goal:** Have the right conversation with Sarah, then with the team. This is THE critical step in a people crisis.

**Important:** The conversation with Sarah is more important than any announcement. If you get this wrong, everything else fails.

---

### A. PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH SARAH

**WHO:** Sarah alone (not public, not with her boss present—that's threatening)

**WHEN:** Within 24 hours of noticing resistance

**YOUR OPENING (not defensive):**
> "Sarah, I noticed you've been skeptical about the AI, and I want to understand why. Your feedback matters to me because you've got 8 years of experience here and you care about this team. What's your real concern?"

**Then LISTEN.** Don't interrupt. Don't defend. Just listen.

**What you might hear:**
- "I think AI is going to replace me"
- "I'm not sure the AI can really do this"
- "Leadership never listens to us anyway"
- "I've seen failed projects before"

**Your next move (ACKNOWLEDGE, don't dismiss):**
> "That's a legitimate concern. Let me be straight with you: [ADDRESS THE FEAR]"

---

**IF it's job loss fear:**

> "I hear you. Let me be clear: We're not replacing anyone. The questions asking 'Where's my order?'—anyone can answer that in 2 minutes. You're the expert on the angry customers, the complex problems, the exceptions.
>
> AI handles the repetitive stuff so YOU can do the work only you can do. And honestly? The work only you can do is more interesting.
>
> In 2 years, I think you could be managing a team instead of answering routine questions. Does that future sound interesting to you?"

**Why this works:**
- You didn't say "Don't worry, you won't be replaced"
- You reframed her job as MORE valuable in the future, not less
- You offered a vision where her expertise becomes more important
- You made it specific (managing a team) not vague (we'll find something)

---

**IF it's technical concern (AI really can't do this):**

> "You're right—AI can't handle everything. That's why we're limiting scope. It's handling order tracking and return policy questions, not complaints or exceptions. Those stay with you.
>
> I've seen the accuracy data; it's solid for routine stuff. I'm asking for 4 more weeks to prove it. If at the end of 4 weeks you're still skeptical, we have a real conversation about whether to keep going. You help me decide. Deal?"

**Why this works:**
- You validated her technical concern (don't dismiss it)
- You clarified the scope (makes it less threatening)
- You invited her to be the judge (gave her agency)
- You set a clear timeline (not "forever")

---

**IF it's trust/autonomy issue:**

> "I know we've asked a lot of you without always asking for your input first. That's fair criticism. Here's what I'm committing to going forward:
>
> Weekly check-ins where we review the AI performance data together. You see the numbers, you help me interpret them. If you spot problems, we listen. You're not just affected by this project—you're steering it.
>
> I want your expertise in the room. Not just as feedback, but as actual decision-making. Deal?"

**Why this works:**
- You acknowledged the past dynamic (didn't excuse it)
- You made a specific commitment (weekly check-ins, not vague promises)
- You offered real agency (you help decide, not just complain)
- You positioned her as valuable, not as the problem

---

### B. AFTER THE CONVERSATION WITH SARAH

**Regardless of what she said, here's what you do next:**

**Make her an offer:**
> "Would you be willing to help me understand how we implement this in a way that works for the team? I'd rather have you designing this WITH me than me imposing it ON you."

**If she says yes:** Great. She's now an ally. Go to Step 3C (Team Meeting).

**If she says no:** You set a boundary.
> "I respect that. Here's where I'm at: We're moving forward with the pilot. I'd rather have you on board, but I understand you have reservations. You can participate in making this work, or you can step back. But the project continues. What do you want to do?"

**Then you follow through.** If she stays, you continue engagement. If she steps back, you accept that and move on with the rest of the team.

---

### C. TEAM MEETING (with Sarah ideally present)

**WHO:** Full customer service team

**WHEN:** Within 2 days of talking to Sarah

**YOUR OPENING:**
> "I want to address the elephant in the room. Some of you are concerned about the AI. Those concerns are legitimate. Let me be direct about what's happening."

**Then deliver the four key messages:**

---

**Message #1: You're not being replaced**

> "If I wanted to replace you, I could hire a call center in India for 1/3 your cost. I didn't. You're here because you're good at this job. And I need you."

**Why this works:** Direct answer to the fear everyone's thinking. Specific (India, cost). Shows you've thought about it.

---

**Message #2: AI has a narrow scope**

> "AI is handling specific routine queries. Order tracking. Policy questions. Things that don't require judgment. Not complaints. Not exceptions. Not things that need empathy. YOU handle all the hard stuff. AI handles the repetitive stuff."

**Why this works:** Makes it concrete. Reduces the threat ("it's not doing MY job, it's doing the routine stuff").

---

**Message #3: You decide if it stays**

> "Here's what I'm NOT doing: Forcing this on you. Here's what I AM doing: Running a 4-week pilot. At the end, we evaluate together. Is this actually helping? Does it free you up for harder work? Does it work as promised? If the answer is no, we stop. You have veto power here."

**Why this works:** Restores agency. They're not victims of the decision—they're judges of whether it works. That's powerful.

---

**Message #4: Your role is changing—for the better**

> "Yes, your role is changing. But not because AI is replacing you. Because we're using AI to remove the boring, repetitive stuff so you can do work that's more interesting and uses your actual skills. I think that's better. What do you think?"

**Why this works:** Reframes change from threat to improvement. Appeals to desire to do meaningful work.

---

**Then (and this is crucial):**

> "What I need from you: Honest feedback. If AI is screwing up, tell me. If it's working, tell me that. Sarah especially—you've got great instincts about this team. I want you leading this feedback process."

**Why this matters:** You've just made Sarah the FEEDBACK LEADER, not the resistance leader. You've given her a leadership role in the pilot. This often turns skeptics into advocates.

---

### D. Communication Summary

**Guide them to summarize:**

> "Who did we talk to, in what order, and what did we say?"

**Answer:**
1. **Sarah alone** (private, listening-focused) → Understand her fear, acknowledge it, offer partnership
2. **Team meeting** (with Sarah, if possible as partner) → Explain what's happening, address fears, offer agency

---

---

## STEP 4: DOCUMENT (5-10 minutes)

**Goal:** Record what you learned about resistance and change management, so future projects don't repeat mistakes.

**This is a people crisis, so documentation is about learning from change dynamics, not technical fixes.**

---

### A. What Happened?

**What to record:**
- **Date discovered:** Week 2
- **Who was resisting:** Sarah (8 years tenure, high influence)
- **What was the stated objection:** "AI can't handle our work"
- **What was the real concern:** Job security + loss of autonomy
- **Scope of resistance:** 3 of 5 agents

**Document template:**
```
TEAM RESISTANCE INCIDENT

Date: Week 2 of Pilot
Who Resisted: Sarah, star agent (8 years tenure)
Stated Objection: "AI can't handle the nuance of our job"
Real Concern: Fear of job replacement + loss of autonomy
Team Impact: 3 of 5 agents stopped using AI suggestions
Key Insight: Stated objection ≠ real concern
```

---

### B. Root Cause Analysis

**What to record:**
- **Why did Sarah resist?** She felt threatened and hadn't been consulted
- **Why didn't we anticipate this?** We didn't involve skeptics in design
- **What could we have done differently?** Get Sarah in the room BEFORE the pilot, not after
- **What does this tell us about change?** People resist change they don't understand or control

**Document template:**
```
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

Immediate Cause: Sarah feared job replacement and had no voice in decision
Deeper Cause: We designed the pilot without involving the team
Systemic Cause: We treated adoption as a "tell people about it" problem, not a "involve them in it" problem

Prevention: For next projects, involve skeptics in design phase, not just volunteers
```

---

### C. The Decision

**What to record:**
- **Decision:** Listen & Engage approach
- **Why this option:** Addresses root cause (fear + powerlessness) instead of symptoms
- **What we committed to:** Private conversation with Sarah, team meeting, weekly check-ins
- **Alternative options considered:** Sideline, fire, pause & redesign (and why they would fail)

**Document template:**
```
DECISION MADE:

Approach: Listen & Engage
Timeline: 2 weeks of intensive engagement + ongoing weekly check-ins
Key Actions:
1. Private conversation with Sarah (within 24 hours)
2. Acknowledge her fear is legitimate
3. Invite her to help design implementation
4. Team meeting: reframe change, restore agency, make her feedback leader
5. Weekly check-ins with Sarah + team

Alternative Approaches Considered:
- Sideline Sarah: Would create martyr, destroy team trust, backfire
- Fire Sarah: Would confirm everyone's fears, destroy adoption, catastrophic
- Pause & Redesign: Valid if we discover AI scope is actually too broad
```

---

### D. The Outcome (To Be Completed Later)

**What you'll document after 2-3 weeks:**
- **Did Sarah cooperate?** Did listening approach work?
- **Did the team adopt?** Did the rest of the agents start using AI again?
- **What was the turning point?** When did she shift from resistant to supporter (if she did)?
- **What surprised you?** What did you learn from the conversation?

**Document template (to be filled in after the conversation):**
```
OUTCOME:

Sarah's Response to Listening Approach: [Cooperative / Still Skeptical / Became Advocate]
Team Adoption Rate: [% of agents now using AI after conversation]
Turning Point: [What changed Sarah's mind, if she changed]
Unexpected Learning: [What surprised you in the conversation]
```

---

### E. The Learning

**What to record for future projects:**

**Learning #1: Stated Objection ≠ Real Concern**
- "AI can't do this work" masks "I'm scared of job loss"
- Different solutions for surface problem vs. root problem
- Ask good questions to diagnose the real fear

**Learning #2: Involvement Beats Announcement**
- Telling people about change = low adoption
- Involving people in design = high adoption
- Get skeptics in the room EARLY, not as a crisis response

**Learning #3: Agency Restores Trust**
- People resist when they feel powerless
- People cooperate when they have a voice in decisions
- Give people veto power over scope, timeline, approach

**Learning #4: Leadership = Listening First, Deciding Second**
- You can't shortcut conversation by just announcing decisions
- Spending time listening now saves time fighting resistance later
- Respect ≠ agreement. You can respect someone's concern and still overrule them

**Document template:**
```
LEARNING FOR FUTURE PROJECTS:

1. Always distinguish between STATED OBJECTION and REAL CONCERN
   - Spend time listening to uncover what people are really worried about
   - Different diagnosis = different solution

2. INVOLVE SKEPTICS EARLY
   - Don't just invite volunteers for pilots
   - Actively bring in the people who are skeptical
   - Their concerns make the project better, not worse

3. RESTORATION OF AGENCY
   - When people feel powerless, they resist
   - When people have a voice, they cooperate
   - Make them judges of whether it works, not just subjects of the change

4. LISTENING AS LEADERSHIP TOOL
   - The conversation is the intervention
   - Time spent in genuine listening saves time fighting covert resistance
   - Respect people's concerns even if you don't agree with them

PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS:
- Add "stakeholder resistance analysis" to project planning
- Involve skeptics in design phase
- Build in "voice and choice" for affected teams
- Regular check-ins with team feedback
- Document what people worried about and how you addressed it
```

---

### F. The Team Impact

**What to record about the team/organizational learning:**

**What we learned about our team:**
- Sarah's concerns were shared by others (legitimate fears about automation)
- Team values autonomy and being consulted
- Influential people matter more than formal authority
- Trust is built through listening, not through announcements

**What we'll do differently next time:**
- Involve team in design of new tools/processes
- Acknowledge fears about job changes directly
- Build in regular feedback loops
- Make affected people judges of whether changes work

---

---

## FACILITATION TIPS FOR GUIDING GROUP DISCUSSION

### During DIAGNOSE Phase:
- **Push beyond surface:** "Sarah says AI doesn't work. Is that her real concern or is something else?"
- **Ask for empathy:** "Why would Sarah be scared? Put yourself in her shoes—8 years in this job, suddenly there's AI."
- **Challenge assumptions:** "You think she's just being difficult. What if she has a legitimate point about job security?"

---

### During DECIDE Phase:
- **Test their choice:** "You want to sideline Sarah. What happens to the rest of the team when they see that?"
- **Make trade-offs visible:** "You're choosing speed. What do you give up in adoption?"
- **Ask about boundaries:** "If Sarah still refuses after you listen, what's your line? Do you let her veto the project?"

---

### During COMMUNICATE Phase:
- **Check the conversation plan:** "How do you start the conversation with Sarah? What's your first sentence?"
- **Practice the hard messages:** "Say it out loud. How do you tell her AI isn't replacing her and sound like you mean it?"
- **Notice sequencing:** "You're announcing to the team before talking to Sarah. What happens then?"

---

### During DOCUMENT Phase:
- **Make it real:** "You're designing the next AI project in 2 years. What do you wish you'd documented from this crisis?"
- **Connect to prevention:** "You documented what happened. Now, how do you prevent this in the next project?"

---

---

## EXPECTED GOOD vs. POOR RESPONSES

### GREEN FLAGS (Excellent Leadership)
✓ Recognized the real concern (job fear) vs. stated objection (AI can't do the work)
✓ Planned to listen to Sarah first (not announce to team first)
✓ Offered genuine partnership (not fake consultation)
✓ Set a clear boundary ("project moves, but you choose how involved you are")
✓ Made her a feedback leader, not a resister
✓ Understood that adoption comes from involvement, not announcement
✓ Documented what they learned about resistance and change

### RED FLAGS (Poor Leadership)
❌ Wanted to "handle Sarah" by fire/sideline (would backfire)
❌ Planned to announce to team without talking to Sarah first
❌ Treated her concerns as illegitimate
❌ Didn't recognize her influence on the rest of the team
❌ Thought they could force adoption without addressing fears
❌ Made it adversarial (leadership vs. team) instead of collaborative
❌ Didn't document the learning for next time

---

---

## DEBRIEF QUESTIONS TO ASK THE GROUP

After they present their decision, ask these follow-ups:

---

### Question 1: Diagnosis
> "Sarah said 'AI can't handle our work.' Was that her real concern or was something else going on?"

**Expected answer:** "No, it was job security and autonomy. She was scared."

**Why ask:** Testing whether they distinguish between stated objection and real concern. This is THE key skill in people crises.

---

### Question 2: The Conversation
> "Walk me through your conversation with Sarah. What's the first thing you say?"

**Expected answer:** "I listen. I ask her what she's really worried about. I don't defend the project or try to convince her."

**Why ask:** Testing whether they lead with listening or defending. Listening = high chance of success. Defending = confirms her fear that leadership doesn't respect her.

---

### Question 3: Team Dynamics
> "If you sideline Sarah instead of engaging her, what happens to the rest of the team?"

**Expected answer:** "They see that leadership doesn't respect dissent. They go silent but resist covertly. Adoption fails."

**Why ask:** Testing whether they understand that one influential person can kill a project if you ignore them.

---

### Question 4: Boundary Setting
> "What's your line? If Sarah refuses to cooperate even after you've listened, what do you do?"

**Expected answer:** "I set a boundary: 'Project continues. You can participate or step back. Your choice.' Then I follow through."

**Why ask:** Testing whether they understand that respect ≠ letting people veto decisions. You can listen and still decide.

---

### Question 5: Prevention
> "How do you avoid this situation in the first place?"

**Expected answer:** "Involve Sarah in the design phase. Don't just invite volunteers—invite the skeptics. Get her concerns on the table BEFORE the pilot, not after."

**Why ask:** Testing whether they see this as a pattern (resistance to change) not just a Sarah problem. Prevention beats crisis response every time.

---

### Question 6: Comparison to Crisis #1
> "Crisis #1 was a technical problem (data corruption). This is a people problem. How is crisis response different?"

**Expected answer:** "In Crisis #1, we fixed the data quickly. In Crisis #2, we can't 'fix' Sarah quickly. We have to engage, listen, rebuild trust. It takes longer but the payoff is adoption instead of compliance."

**Why ask:** Testing whether they're connecting the two crises. Different crises need different approaches.

---

---

## KEY INSIGHTS FOR CRISIS #2

**This is a PEOPLE CRISIS, not a TECHNICAL CRISIS**

The framework still applies (Diagnose → Decide → Communicate → Document), but how it plays out is very different:

| Aspect | Crisis #1 (Technical) | Crisis #2 (People) |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Diagnose** | Find the technical problem (data) | Find the real fear (job loss) |
| **Decide** | Choose technical solution (retrain) | Choose engagement approach (listen) |
| **Communicate** | Announce the fix to stakeholders | Have a conversation with the person |
| **Document** | Technical lessons (data validation) | People lessons (change management) |
| **Timeline** | Hours/days to fix | Weeks to rebuild trust |
| **Success looks like** | System works correctly again | Team voluntarily adopts the change |

**The big lesson:** You can't announce people out of resistance. You have to engage them.

## FOR YOUR FACILITATION

**During the simulation, watch for:**

**Good signs:**
- Group recognizes Sarah's fear is legitimate (not just "she's being difficult")
- Plan to listen to Sarah before announcing to team
- Willingness to give her a role in the solution
- Understanding that this takes time

**Red flags:**
- "Let's just move forward without Sarah"
- "She's being irrational, we should fire her"
- "We'll announce the decision and she'll fall in line"
- No plan for how to engage the rest of the team

**If group gets stuck:**
- "What would you want if you'd been in this job 8 years and suddenly there's AI?"
- "Why does leadership listening matter more than leadership being right?"
- "How do you get adoption without involvement?"

**After their presentation, use the debrief questions to pull out learning about:**
- Distinguishing stated objection from real concern
- The power of listening in leadership
- How one influential person can impact a whole team
- Prevention (involve skeptics early, not as crisis response)
