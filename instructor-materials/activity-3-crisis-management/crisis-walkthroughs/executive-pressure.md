# Crisis #3: Executive Pressure

## When Your Boss Wants Faster Than Safe

---

## The Scenario

**Week 4 of Live Pilot:**
- Project is going well:
  - AI accuracy: 88%
  - Customer satisfaction: 82%
  - But cost savings are $15K (not the projected $50K)
- CEO calls you in, frustrated
- CEO says: "Competitors are scaling in 8 weeks. Why are we moving slowly? Expand to ALL query types and ALL customers in 4 weeks."
- You know 4 weeks is dangerous
- But the CEO is your boss
- **You have 30 minutes to respond**

---

## Applying the Framework

### **DIAGNOSE**

**What's really driving this demand?**

| Driver | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| Competitive pressure | "Competitors are doing it, so we look slow" |
| Board pressure | "Board is watching. CEO needs to show progress." |
| Cost pressure | "Projected $50K savings; only at $15K. Need ROI numbers." |
| Impatience | "We're 4 weeks in. Expected faster results." |

**Key insight:** The CEO isn't being unreasonable. She's under pressure from above.

**What are the real constraints?**
- Current scope took 6-8 weeks
- Full scope (all query types) requires 7-8 weeks minimum
  - New data training: 3-4 weeks
  - Testing new scope: 1-2 weeks
  - Team training: 1-2 weeks
- 4 weeks = not enough time without sacrificing quality

**What's the real question?**
- Surface: "Can we expand in 4 weeks?"
- Real: "How fast can we show business value without breaking the project?"

### **DECIDE**

**Your options:**

| Option | Speed | Risk | Relationship | Long-Term Success |
|--------|-------|------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Say No** | Slow (8 weeks) | Low | Damaged | Medium |
| **Say Yes & Hope** | Fast (4 weeks) | VERY HIGH | Good short-term | Very Low |
| **Educate & Propose Compromise** | Medium (6 weeks) | Medium | Improved | High |
| **Escalate Decision** | Depends | Medium-High | Tense | Depends |

**Recommended: Educate & Propose Compromise**

Don't say yes or no. Show the CEO the data on what 4 weeks requires. Then propose a middle path:
- **Week 5-6:** Expand to returns policy queries (minimal new training)
- **Week 7-8:** Add product care queries
- **Week 9-14:** Full expansion including complaints/exceptions

**By week 8: 60% of queries in AI** (faster progress for board)
**By week 14: 100% of queries in AI** (controlled growth)

**Why?** Gives CEO a win (faster than original 8-week plan) without betting the project on a risky 4-week sprint.

### **COMMUNICATE**

**Before the conversation, prepare your data:**
- Current performance (88% accuracy, 82% satisfaction)
- What 4 weeks actually requires (timeline breakdown)
- Cost of rushing (bugs in production, team burnout)
- Your alternative proposal (the middle path)

**Your opening:**
> "I hear the urgency about expanding faster. I've been thinking about this. Let me walk you through what 4 weeks actually requires, then I want to propose something that gets you faster results without the risk."

**Key: You're not refusing. You're educating and proposing.**

**Walk through:**

1. **Acknowledge her concern**
> "The board pressure is real. I want to get you faster progress without betting the project."

2. **Show the data**
> "Full expansion needs 3-4 weeks for data training, 2 weeks testing, 1-2 weeks team training. That's 7-8 weeks minimum. Four weeks means skipping testing or training—that's when things break."

3. **Share the risk**
> "When you scale too fast without proper testing, you hit problems around week 12. Errors compound. Now you're fixing bugs in production affecting thousands of customers."

4. **Propose the middle path**
> "Here's what I'm proposing: Expand to 60% of queries by week 8 (faster than original), then full scale by week 14. You can show the board progress at week 8 without the risk."

5. **Reframe success**
> "In 6 months, the board sees either 'controlled expansion that succeeded' or 'rushed expansion that failed.' You'll be the leader who made the smart call."

6. **Ask for decision**
> "Can you buy into this plan? It's more aggressive than my first timeline, less aggressive than 4 weeks. It's the middle ground that works."

**If she pushes back:**
> "If you want to overrule this recommendation, that's your call. But I need it documented. Here's why I'm not comfortable with the risk..."

### **DOCUMENT**

**What to record:**
- Date and CEO's demand
- Why she demanded it (board pressure, competitive pressure)
- Your recommendation and reasoning
- CEO's decision
- **Key learning:** Managing up means understanding the pressure your boss is under, not just saying no.

**What to change next time:**
- Brief executives weekly with progress and realistic timelines
- Share risks early so they're not surprised
- Have buffers built in so you can accelerate if needed
- Discuss scope/timeline/quality trade-offs upfront

---

## Key Insights

**This teaches you:**
- Leadership pressure comes from above (CEO isn't just being difficult)
- Data beats opinion every time
- "No" loses to "Yes, and here's how we do it right"
- Managing up = helping your boss succeed under their constraints
- Proposing alternatives > refusing

**The difference from Crisis #1 & #2:**
- Crisis #1: Technical problem → fix the data
- Crisis #2: People problem → listen and engage
- Crisis #3: Leadership problem → educate and propose alternatives

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Just saying no**
*"4 weeks is impossible."*
**Better:** Show data, propose alternative.

❌ **Getting defensive**
*"You don't understand the constraints."*
**Better:** Educate, don't lecture.

❌ **Lacking data**
*"I don't think it will work."*
**Better:** "Here's the data showing why it won't work."

❌ **Making it adversarial**
*"Leadership vs. team"*
**Better:** "How do we both succeed?"

❌ **Giving in completely**
*"Sure, 4 weeks, we'll figure it out."*
**Better:** Propose middle path with data.

## Takeaway

When executive pressure hits:
1. **Diagnose the real pressure** (what's the CEO under pressure FROM?)
2. **Prepare your data** (don't respond emotionally)
3. **Propose alternatives** (not just refusals)
4. **Frame as partnership** ("How do we both succeed?")
5. **Set a boundary if needed** ("I'm not comfortable with that risk.")

**The goal:** Help your boss succeed while protecting the project.

This is what management leadership looks like: **data + empathy > stubbornness**.
