## BEFORE YOU START

### Materials Checklist
- [ ] Print Pilot Scoping worksheets (1 per group, 4-5 people per group)
- [ ] Print Crisis scenario cards (4 cards, give one at a time)
- [ ] Print Scale/Pivot/Kill data sheet
- [ ] Print Speed-Dating role cards (6 roles, print 2-3 copies each)
- [ ] Sticky notes & markers for gallery walk
- [ ] Timer (visible to groups)
- [ ] Whiteboard/flip chart for notes

### Room Setup
- **Groups of 4-5** for Scoping, Crisis, Scale/Pivot/Kill
- **Pairs facing each other** for Speed-Dating (6 pairs, one per stakeholder)
- **Visible timer** so groups can self-manage time pressure

---

## ACTIVITY 1: PILOT SCOPING (See 1_PILOT_SCOPING_EXERCISE.md for full guide)

### Quick Flow (30 min exercise + 20 min debrief)

**Start (1 min):**
> "You have 30 minutes to scope a pilot project. Here's the scenario. Everything is on the worksheet. Questions?"

**Monitor (20 min):**
- Walk around. Don't answer questions; ask back.
- ❌ Don't say: "That scope size is good"
- ✓ Do ask: "Why did you choose that size? What would happen if you chose bigger?"

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ "Let's automate everything" → Too ambitious
- ❌ "Let's do 10% to be safe" → Too timid
- ❌ "We'll figure metrics later" → No success criteria
- ✓ "40% of queries, 2 types, 8 weeks" → Good

**Wrap (5 min):**
> "Time. Finish your sentence. Everyone post your scope on the wall. We'll discuss after tea."

---

### Debrief (20 min) - Quick Flow

**Gallery Walk (3 min):**
- Groups post answers
- Everyone reads 2-3 others

**Quick Share (2 min):**
- Ask 1 group: "Why did you choose THOSE query types?"
- Ask another: "Why different scope?"

**Discussion (10 min) - Ask These 4 Questions:**

| Question | Why | Listen For |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| "Why those query types?" | Tests risk thinking | Do they have rationale? |
| "How big a pilot is big enough?" | Tests sample size thinking | "6-8 weeks for edge cases" |
| "You set accuracy at 90%. Why not 95%?" | Tests realistic targets | "90% is practical" |
| "At what point would you kill this?" | Tests go/no-go thinking | Clear threshold, not wishy-washy |

**Land the Learning (5 min):**
> "Best pilots are Goldilocks—not too ambitious, not too timid. You just did what great PMs do: limit scope and define success."

---

## ACTIVITY 2: CRISIS SIMULATION (See 2_CRISIS_MANAGEMENT_SIMULATION.md for full guide)

### Four Crises × 20 Min Each (80 min total)

**Format:** 15 min work → 3 min presentation → 2 min debrief per crisis

### CRISIS #1: Data Quality (Week 1, AI giving wrong info)

**Your setup:**
> "Week 1 of live pilot. AI is giving wrong tracking numbers. One customer got tracking numbers for THREE orders. What do you do? 15 minutes."

**What good looks like:**
- ✓ Pause the AI immediately (safety first)
- ✓ Communicate clearly to customers ("We're investigating, you'll chat with a human shortly")
- ✓ Tell CEO this is why pilots work ("Better to find this now than after scaling")

**Red flags:**
- ❌ "Hope nobody notices"
- ❌ "Keep it running, monitor closely"
- ❌ "Blame the data team"

**Quick debrief Q's:**
1. "Pause or continue?" → Listen: Should say pause
2. "How tell CEO without looking bad?" → "Frame as pilot success"
3. "Team is frustrated. How keep them engaged?" → "Celebrate that we caught it"

---

### CRISIS #2: Team Resistance (Week 2, Star agent Sarah resists)

**Your setup:**
> "Week 2. Your star agent Sarah (8 years tenure) is actively discouraging the team from using AI. Three volunteers stopped using it. What do you do? 15 minutes."

**What good looks like:**
- ✓ Listen to Sarah's real concern (job security, not the tech)
- ✓ Have 1-on-1 conversation (not public callout)
- ✓ Position AI as "your assistant, not your replacement"
- ✓ Give team veto power ("After 4 weeks, you decide if this stays")

**Red flags:**
- ❌ "Fire Sarah"
- ❌ "Ignore the resistance"
- ❌ "Force adoption"
- ❌ "Isolate Sarah as the problem"

**Quick debrief Q's:**
1. "What was Sarah's REAL problem?" → "Job security, not tech"
2. "How tell difference between tech feedback and fear?" → "Ask good questions, listen"
3. "If Sarah refuses to cooperate?" → "Clear boundary: 'Project moves with or without you'"

---

### CRISIS #3: Executive Pressure (Week 4, CEO wants 4-week scale)

**Your setup:**
> "Week 4. CEO hears competitor scaled fast. 'I want all query types, all customers, 4 weeks. Do it.' You know this will destroy the project. What do you do? 15 minutes."

**What good looks like:**
- ✓ Show data ("88% accuracy, 82% satisfaction")
- ✓ Propose middle path ("Expand to return policy in week 6, full scale by week 14")
- ✓ Reframe risk ("Fast that fails is worse optics than controlled that works")
- ✓ Don't say "no"; say "here's what yes costs"

**Red flags:**
- ❌ "No, we can't" (defensive)
- ❌ "Okay, whatever you want" (no spine)
- ❌ "Let's do it poorly" (reckless)

**Quick debrief Q's:**
1. "How tell CEO no without pushing back?" → "Offer options, show trade-offs"
2. "What's your middle path?" → Should have one
3. "Would you walk away if CEO forced 4-week timeline?" → Tests integrity

---

### CRISIS #4: Ethical Dilemma (Week 6, AI is biased)

**Your setup:**
> "Week 6. Data scientist finds AI is biased against rural/low-income customers (trained on historical data). Can fix with accuracy cost (88%→85%). Or ship biased version; customers won't notice. What do you do? 15 minutes."

**What good looks like:**
- ✓ Fix the bias ("It's the right thing AND the smart business")
- ✓ Reframe as long-term thinking ("Discovering in 2 years is a scandal")
- ✓ Be transparent ("CEO, accuracy drops to 85%, here's why it matters")
- ✓ Position as advantage ("We build bias-testing into all future projects")

**Red flags:**
- ❌ "Ship it, nobody will notice"
- ❌ "Fix it secretly, don't tell CEO"
- ❌ "It's a business, ethics don't matter"
- ❌ "The bias is mild, so it's okay"

**Quick debrief Q's:**
1. "When ethics and business conflict?" → "They don't long-term"
2. "How identify bias?" → "Test for it proactively"
3. "What if CEO insists on biased version?" → "Clear boundary + document decision"

---

### Overall Crisis Debrief (15 min after all 4)

**Ask These Big Questions:**

1. **"What pattern do you notice across all 4 crises?"**
   - Expected: "They're not technical; they're people and values"

2. **"How many variants happen in real projects?"**
   - Answer: "All of them"

3. **"Which was hardest?"**
   - Usually #4 (ethical dilemma) or #3 (managing up)

4. **"What would you do differently in your real project?"**
   - Expected: "Anticipate these. Communicate early. Have relationships ready before crisis."

---

## ACTIVITY 3: SPEED-DATING (See 3_SPEED_DATING_ACTIVITY.md for full guide)

### Quick Flow (30 min × 5 min rotations)

**Setup (2 min):**
- Assign someone to each of 6 roles
- Give them role cards
> "You're playing a real person with real concerns. Push back if the PM dismisses you. PM's: You have 5 minutes. Can't give same pitch to everyone."

**Run 6 Rotations (30 min total):**
- 5 min per conversation
- Call time loudly: "Time! Everyone rotate clockwise"
- Walk around, watch

**What to Watch For:**
- ✓ PM asks "What matters to you?" before pitching
- ✓ PM tailors pitch to stakeholder's concerns
- ✓ PM listens, doesn't just talk
- ✓ Role player pushes back; PM responds respectfully

- ❌ PM gives same pitch to everyone
- ❌ PM talks AT stakeholder
- ❌ PM dismisses concerns
- ❌ Role player doesn't push back

---

### Integrated Debrief (5 min, quick)

**4 Questions:**
1. "Which stakeholder was hardest to win?" → (CFO or Data Scientist)
2. "What surprised you about what people cared about?" → (Different priorities)
3. "If only 3 stakeholders, which 3?" → (CEO, Data Scientist, Manager)
4. "How does your pitch change knowing all 6?" → (More realistic, more involvement)

---

## ACTIVITY 4: SCALE/PIVOT/KILL (See 4_SCALE_PIVOT_KILL_EXERCISE.md for full guide)

### Quick Flow (45 min)

**Setup (5 min):**
> "You have pilot data. Check it against YOUR Go/No-Go criteria from Exercise 1. Decide: Scale, Pivot, or Kill? Write 1-page recommendation and present 3 min. 40 minutes, go."

**Monitor (35 min):**
- Let them struggle
- If stuck, ask: "How many of your criteria did you meet?"
- If confused, ask: "What's solvable vs. fundamental?"

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ "We spent money so we scale" (sunk cost fallacy)
- ❌ "Close enough" (that's not how go/no-go works)
- ❌ Cherry-picking positive data only
- ❌ No reference to their own criteria

**Presentations (3 min each):**
- Listen to reasoning
- Ask follow-ups: "If accuracy was 90%, would you scale?"

---

## DEBRIEF FORMULA (Use This For Any Activity)

**The 10-Minute Debrief (Good Default):**

1. **Gallery walk or quick present (3 min)**
   - Everyone sees the work

2. **Ask 2-3 discussion questions (5 min)**
   - Ask question → Listen to 1-2 answers → Don't lecture
   - Move to next question

3. **Land the learning (2 min)**
   - One clear takeaway
   - Connect to their real job
   - Done

**The 20-Minute Debrief (If You Have Time):**
1. Gallery walk (3 min)
2. Ask 4-5 questions with follow-ups (10 min)
3. Land learning + transition (7 min)

**The 3-Minute Debrief (If Short on Time):**
1. Ask one question (1 min)
2. Listen to 1-2 answers (1 min)
3. Land the learning (1 min)

---

## QUESTIONS PARTICIPANTS WILL ASK

### "What's the right answer?"
> "There isn't one. Show me your thinking. Better reasoning beats a 'right' answer you can't explain."

### "Can you help us?"
> "Sure. Tell me what you're struggling with. What's your thinking so far?"

### "Is our scope too ambitious?"
> "What do you think? What happens if you go bigger? Smaller?"

### "How detailed does this need to be?"
> "Detailed enough someone reading it understands what you're building and why. Not a novel, but specific."

### "What if we run out of time?"
> "You have X minutes left. Make a decision with what you have. Perfect is the enemy of done."

### "Should we include this other thing?"
> "What's your thinking? Does it fit your scope boundaries? What would you cut instead?"

---

## FACILITATION DOS & DON'TS

### DO:
- ✓ Ask questions instead of giving answers
- ✓ Celebrate good thinking publicly
- ✓ Listen more than you talk
- ✓ Keep groups on pace with timer
- ✓ Connect exercises to their real jobs
- ✓ End each activity with one clear learning

### DON'T:
- ❌ Lecture during debrief (you already lectured in AM)
- ❌ Tell them they're wrong (let them discover)
- ❌ Announce the "right answer" (invite them to improve)
- ❌ Skip debrief to save time (debrief IS where learning happens)
- ❌ Let one person dominate (call on others)
- ❌ Go too deep on one question (you have 4-5 to cover)

---

## KEEPER PHRASES (Say These)

**For motivating:**
- "This is where it gets real."
- "You're thinking like a PM right now."
- "That's the kind of thinking that separates good projects from disasters."

**For pushing deeper:**
- "I hear the decision. Help me understand the thinking."
- "What data would make you confident?"
- "What could prove you wrong?"

**For wrapping up:**
- "Here's what matters: ___"
- "That's the insight. Remember that when you face the real situation."
- "You just did real PM work."

---

## TIMING NOTES

- **Pilot Scoping:** Takes exactly as long as you give it (groups self-manage)
- **Crisis Simulation:** Can run fast (15 min work) or slow (20 min work). Adjust as needed.
- **Speed-Dating:** Moves fast. No flexibility on timing (5 min × 6 = 30 min fixed)
- **Scale/Pivot/Kill:** Takes 40-45 min for real thinking. Don't rush.

---

## IF YOU'RE SHORT ON TIME

**Minimum Viable Masterclass:**
- Keep: Lecture + Pilot Scoping (+ debrief) + Crisis #1-2 (+ debrief) + Scale/Pivot/Kill
- Cut: Crisis #3-4, Speed-Dating, full Action Planning
- Time: 4 hours

---

## IF YOU HAVE EXTRA TIME

**Add (in order):**
1. Real case study from your company (30 min)
2. Guest speaker: Real PM who led AI projects (20 min Q&A)
3. Extended Action Planning (participants present their plans)
4. Second Speed-Dating round with different stakeholders

---

## COMMON FACILITATION CHALLENGES

### Group is stuck
**Response:** "Let's start with your biggest risk. What keeps you up at night? Build your scope around managing that."

### Group finishes early
**Response:** "Now add a constraint. Your budget got cut in half. What changes? Who do you need to convince?"

### Someone gets emotional
**Response:** "This is hitting something real for you. That's good—it means you care about getting it right. What's the real issue?"

### Running out of time
**Response:** Shorten debrief to 10 min. Hit key learning, move on. Don't skip debrief entirely.

### Someone dominates
**Response:** "Good points. Let's hear from someone else. Sarah, you've been quiet—what's your take?"

## YOU'VE GOT THIS

Trust the exercises. They work. Your job is:
1. Give clear instructions
2. Don't help too much (let them struggle)
3. Ask good questions in debrief
4. Land one clear learning per activity
5. Keep moving

The learning happens in the exercises and debrief, not in you talking.
