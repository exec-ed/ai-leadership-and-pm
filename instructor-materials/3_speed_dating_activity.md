## STAKEHOLDER ROLES & WHAT TO LISTEN FOR

### ROLE 1: EXECUTIVE SPONSOR / CEO

**Who They Are:** VP of Operations. Approved the budget. Reputation on the line.

**What They Care About:**
- ROI and business value
- Timeline and getting results
- Risk and not looking bad
- Speed (competitors are doing this faster)

**Their Biggest Worry:**
*"We'll waste $150K and I'll look bad to the board."*

**What Wins Them Over:**
- Clear metrics tied to business value
- Realistic timeline
- Evidence of risk management
- Regular updates with real data

**What to Listen For in the PM's Pitch:**
- ✓ Do they lead with business impact, not technology?
- ✓ Do they have a concrete timeline?
- ✓ Do they show they understand what the CEO is worried about?
- ✓ Do they frame their pilot as "learning fast" not "slow and cautious"?

**How You (the CEO) Respond:**
- **To good PM:** "Okay, I see the plan. Clear metrics, monthly updates, realistic scope. I'm comfortable with this."
- **To vague PM:** "This is too vague on ROI. Too expensive. Let's find someone more structured to lead this."

### ROLE 2: CFO / FINANCE

**Who They Are:** Chief Financial Officer. Manages budget. Has seen projects overrun before.

**What They Care About:**
- Budget compliance
- ROI timeline

**Their Biggest Worry:**
*"Tech projects always overrun. We'll spend $150K then ask for another $75K."*

**What Wins Them Over:**
- Detailed budget breakdown
- Conservative ROI calculation
- Contingency planning
- Alternative comparison (why AI > hiring more staff)

**What to Listen For in the PM's Pitch:**
- ✓ Can they break down the $150K into specific line items?

- ✓ Do they talk about contingency?
- ✓ Can they defend the spend compared to alternatives?

**How You (the CFO) Respond:**
- **To detailed PM:** "Okay, I see the numbers. I'll support this. But I audit spend monthly and expect updates."
- **To vague PM:** "Not enough detail on costs. Not enough rigor on ROI. Finance can't approve this."

### ROLE 3: DATA SCIENTIST / AI ENGINEER

**Who They Are:** Machine Learning specialist. Excited about AI but frustrated by unrealistic expectations.

**What They Care About:**
- Technical feasibility
- Data quality
- Realistic timeline for AI development
- Clear scope (what they're building vs. not building)

**Their Biggest Worry:**
*"Management wants magic in 3 months. Data quality is poor. I'll build something that fails publicly and my reputation gets destroyed."*

**What Wins Them Over:**
- Realistic timeline (8 weeks for data prep + model training)
- Clear scope ("you're building X, not Y")
- Data commitment upfront ($15K for data cleaning)
- No pressure on deadlines

**What to Listen For in the PM's Pitch:**
- ✓ Do they demonstrate understanding of technical complexity?
- ✓ Do they give realistic timeline?
- ✓ Do they show they've thought about data quality?
- ✓ Are they giving the data scientist autonomy or pressuring them?

**How You (the Data Scientist) Respond:**
- **To realistic PM:** "Okay, realistic timeline and scope. This is doable. I'm in."
- **To pressuring PM:** "This is impossible as scoped. You're asking for magic. I'm not building something that fails publicly."

### ROLE 4: CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER

**Who They Are:** Manager of the 25-person team. 8 years tenure. Team is their responsibility.

**What They Care About:**
- Team morale and job security
- Operational reality (will this actually work?)
- Their own burden (will I have to do extra work?)
- Having a voice in the decision

**Their Biggest Worry:**
*"Leadership is going to force AI on my team without listening. My team will resist. I'll be blamed when it fails."*

**What Wins Them Over:**
- Partnership ("you're co-designing this")
- Job security ("no layoffs")
- Support and training
- Real voice ("you have veto power")

**What to Listen For in the PM's Pitch:**
- ✓ Do they position this as a partnership or a done-to-you?

- ✓ Do they promise to listen if the team raises issues?

**How You (the Manager) Respond:**
- **To partnership PM:** "Okay, I'll involve my team. But you have to listen when we raise operational issues."
- **To top-down PM:** "You haven't thought about operational reality. This will fail. I'm not supporting something my team doesn't believe in."

### ROLE 5: IT SECURITY MANAGER

**Who They Are:** Director of IT Security. Manages data security and regulatory compliance.

**What They Care About:**
- Data security (is customer data protected?)
- Compliance (GDPR, privacy regulations)
- System stability
- Liability (who's responsible if there's a breach?)

**Their Biggest Worry:**
*"Customer data will be exposed. We'll violate regulations. Some vendor will be a security liability. IT will be blamed for the breach."*

**What Wins Them Over:**
- Data protection plan (data never leaves servers, encrypted)
- Compliance review (meets all regulations)
- Vendor vetting (vendor has SOC2, we've audited them)
- Involvement (you approve the architecture)

- ✓ Do they have a data protection plan?
- ✓ Can they name which vendor and why?
- ✓ Do they know what compliance requirements exist?
- ✓ Are they inviting IT into the design or presenting completed plans?

**How You (IT Security) Respond:**

- Accuracy (does it give the right answer?)
- Privacy (what are you doing with my data?)
- Choice (can I talk to a human if I want?)

**Their Biggest Worry:**
*"AI will waste my time. The company is using AI to save money on ME. They'll misuse my data."*

**What Wins Them Over:**
- Speed benefit ("most queries in <5 min vs. 26 hours")
- Accuracy ("we tested this; 90%+ accurate")
- Privacy ("your data stays with us")
- Choice ("you can talk to a human anytime")

**What to Listen For in the PM's Pitch:**
- ✓ Do they lead with customer benefit, not company benefit?
- ✓ Do they address privacy unprompted?
- ✓ Do they offer choice (human escalation)?
- ✓ Do they answer: "Is this better for me or cheaper for you?"

**How You (the Customer) Respond:**
- **To customer-focused PM:** "Okay, I'll try the AI. If it's fast and accurate, I like it."
- **To company-focused PM:** "You're making this for you, not for me. I'll avoid using it."

## FACILITATION TIPS

### Setting Up for Success
1. **Brief the role players:** "You're not caricatures. You're real people with real concerns. Push back if the PM dismisses your concerns."
2. **Brief the PMs:** "You have 5 minutes. You can't give the same pitch to everyone. Tailor to what each person cares about."
3. **Use a visible timer:** PMs need to know time pressure is real.
4. **Rotate loudly:** "Time! Everyone move clockwise to the next stakeholder."

### During the Activity
- **Watch for these good behaviors:**
  - ✓ PM asks "What's important to you?" before pitching
  - ✓ PM listens to the stakeholder's concern
  - ✓ PM tailors pitch based on what they hear
  - ✓ PM acknowledges trade-offs

- **Watch for these poor behaviors:**
  - ❌ PM gives the same pitch to all stakeholders
  - ❌ PM talks at stakeholders instead of with them
  - ❌ PM dismisses concerns ("Don't worry, we'll figure it out")
  - ❌ PM doesn't listen; just talks

### Keeping Momentum
- **Start strong:** Explain the activity clearly. Set expectations.
- **Keep time:** Announce 1-minute warning, then call time loudly
- **Celebrate efforts:** After a rotation, quick shout-out: "Notice how that PM tailored their message?"
- **Stay visible:** Walk around, watch conversations, nod

## INTEGRATED DEBRIEF (5-10 min after all 6 rotations)

**Format:** Quick questions to the whole group. Not lengthy discussion—just surface the learning.

### Question 1: Observation
**"Which stakeholder was hardest to win over?"**

- *Common answer:* CFO (wants specifics) or Data Scientist (wants realistic scope)
- *Teaching point:* Both are hard because they're detail-oriented and risk-averse. You win them by being specific and realistic.

---

### Question 2: Differences
**"What surprised you about what each stakeholder cared about?"**

- *Expected:* "CEO cares about optics, not just ROI. Customer Service Manager cares about being heard."
- *Teaching point:* People care about mattering. If you listen and show their input shapes the project, everyone cooperates.

---

### Question 3: Prioritization
**"If you could only win over 3 of the 6 stakeholders, which 3 would you choose and why?"**

- *Staff model:* "CEO (air cover), Data Scientist (feasibility), Customer Service Manager (delivery). Everyone else is important but those 3 are critical."
- *Teaching point:* Different stakeholders have different veto power. Know which ones matter most.

---

### Question 4: Adaptation
**"How would your project pitch change if you knew it had to work for all 6 stakeholders?"**

- *Expected:* "More realistic timelines, more budget for data/security, more involvement of operations team."
- *Teaching point:* When you think about ALL stakeholders, you build a more resilient project.

## KEY LEARNING POINTS

**Emphasize these takeaways:**

### 1. "Different Stakeholders Care About Different Things—That's Not a Problem, It's an Opportunity"

- CEO wants ROI → Meet it
- Data Scientist wants realistic scope → Respect it
- Manager wants voice → Give it
- Everyone cooperates

### 2. "Stakeholder Management Is the Real Skill"

- Technology is easy
- Getting 6 different people with different priorities to pull together is hard
- That's what separates good PMs from great PMs

### 3. "People Cooperate When They Feel Heard"

- Not when they're overruled
- Not when they're ignored
- Not when you promise "trust me"
- When they feel their concerns shaped the project

### 4. "Listening Beats Talking"

- The PM who asks "What matters to you?" wins stakeholders faster than the PM with a canned pitch
- Tailor your message to what people care about
- Different audience = different message

## COMMON ISSUES & HOW TO HANDLE

### "I didn't get to talk to all the stakeholders"
**Response:** "That's realistic. Real projects don't have equal time for everyone. You manage it. Some stakeholders get more attention than others."

### "The CEO and Customer disagree on what matters"
**Response:** "Exactly. Welcome to stakeholder management. Your job is balancing conflicting priorities. That's why you get paid the big bucks."

### A role player stays quiet / doesn't push back
**Response:** (After activity) Remind them: "Role players, you're supposed to push back! You represent real concerns. Help the PM discover whether their plan actually works."

### A PM gives up / stops trying
**Response:** "You still have time. What would you do differently with your next stakeholder?"

## VARIATIONS (If You Have Time)

### Variation 1: Add a 7th Stakeholder
- **Regulatory Affairs Officer:** Cares about compliance, brand risk, industry reputation
- **What they care about:** Legal compliance, audit readiness, public perception if anything goes wrong

### Variation 2: Add Competing Priorities
- "CEO wants it in 4 weeks. Data Scientist says 8 weeks minimum. Manager says team isn't ready. Go." (Tests conflict resolution)

### Variation 3: Second Round with Different Stakeholders
- First round: All 6 classic roles
- Second round: Different stakeholders from the participant's actual organization (if they bring them)
