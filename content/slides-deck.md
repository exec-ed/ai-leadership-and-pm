# The Reality of AI Projects


![](./images/80-20-failure-rates.png)

::: {.notes}

The Brutal Truth About AI Projects. **80% of AI projects fail to deliver value**

*Source: Gartner, 2023*

- "Let that sink in - 4 out of 5 AI projects fail"
- "Technical Issues: 20% - Algorithm doesn't work, Data quality problems, Infrastructure failures"
- "People & Organisational Issues: 80% - Stakeholder resistance, Unclear objectives, Poor change management, Ethical oversights, Wrong metrics, Scope creep"
- "Not because technology doesn't work..."
- "AI project leadership is NOT primarily about technology"
- "It's about people, politics, and change"
- "That's what we're focusing on today"
:::

# Real AI Project Failures


![](./images/three-failure-stories.png)

::: {.notes}

🏥 Healthcare: Perfect algorithm, clinicians didn't trust it

🏪 Retail: Worked great, destroyed jobs and PR

💰 Banking: Solved the problem, discriminated against people


- "These are real projects (anonymised)"
- "Healthcare: $5M investment, 2-year development, 95% accuracy in lab testing. Clinicians refused to use it. Forgot about user adoption."
- "Retail: Reduced stockouts by 40% (success!). Automated away jobs, union backlash, PR disaster. Didn't manage people impact."
- "Banking: Improved processing speed by 70%. Discriminated against protected groups. Ethical oversight missing."
- "All had solid technology"
- "All failed because of people and process issues"
- "Today you'll practice navigating exactly these challenges"
:::

# Traditional vs. AI Projects

![](./images/traditional-vs-ai-paths.png)

::: {.notes}

**Two Different Journeys**

Traditional: Known → Linear → Clear → Predictable → Technical risk
AI: Emergent → Iterative → Evolving → Experimental → Organisational risk

- "Many of you have led successful traditional projects"
- "AI projects require DIFFERENT skills - not better or worse, different"
- "Traditional: Requirements known upfront, linear progression, success criteria clear, predictable timeline, technical risk primary, implementation focus, Gantt charts rule"
- "AI: Requirements emerge through experimentation, iterative/hypothesis-driven, success criteria evolve, we'll know more after pilot, organisational risk dominant, learning & adaptation focus, experiments rule"
- "Today we focus on what's unique about AI leadership"
:::

# The AI Project Lifecycle

![](./images/ai-project-lifecycle-journey.png)

::: {.notes}
- "The journey: Ideation → Scoping → Pilot → Evaluation → Decision → Scale/Pivot/Kill (then loop back)"
- "Most organisations rush through Scoping - that's where you design for success"
- "Most fail at Evaluation - they don't measure the right things"
- "Most struggle with Kill decision - sunk cost fallacy is powerful"
- "Today you'll practice the hardest parts: Scoping, Crisis Management, and Scale/Kill decisions"
:::

# Core Framework

![](./images/three-pillars-framework.png)

::: {.notes}

## Humans in the Loop

**AI ≠ Replace Humans**
**AI = Humans + Technology Working Together**

**Three Pillars:**
- Stakeholder Orchestration
- Change Navigation
- Ethical Leadership

- "This is the core principle: AI projects aren't about replacing humans with technology"
- "They're about designing new ways for humans and AI to work together"
- "This framework will guide us through every exercise today"
- "These three pillars aren't fluffy - they're mission-critical"
- "These pillars will help you navigate every challenge you face"
- "Stakeholder Orchestration: Align diverse interests and motivations"
- "Change Navigation: Guide organisations through AI transformation"
- "Ethical Leadership: Make values-based decisions under uncertainty"

# Meet RetailFlow

50 stores • $150M revenue • 2,000 people • Australia

**Problem:** Customer satisfaction 78% → 68%, 26-hour response times

**Solution:** AI chatbot pilot (2 weeks live)

**Your Role:** AI Project Manager

::: {.notes}
- "This is a realistic but fictional company"
- "We'll use RetailFlow for all exercises today"
- "You are the AI Project Manager"
- "The chatbot pilot launched 2 weeks ago"
- "It's the mix of physical retail and e-commerce that makes this complex"

# Exercise: Stakeholder Speed Dating

![](./images/speed-dating.png)

**Objective:** Experience AI project stakeholder perspectives firsthand

::: {.notes}

**What you'll do:**

1. Each person receives a **role card** (one of 6 stakeholders)
2. Read your role card carefully
3. Have **5-minute conversations** with different stakeholders
4. Stay in character - embrace their fears and motivations
5. Take notes in your workbook

**Materials:** Role cards will be distributed now

- Distribute role cards (one per person, mixed across tables)
- Take a few minutes to read role cards
- Explain: "You'll rotate conversations every 5 minutes when I ring the bell"
- "Stay in character - experience their perspective, not your own"
- Set timer, ring bell every 5 minutes for rotations
:::

# Exercise: Pilot Scoping Challenge

![](./images/pilot-program.png)

**Objective:** Design a well-scoped AI pilot for RetailFlow

::: {.notes}

**The Challenge:**
RetailFlow's customer service is broken (26-hour response times, 68% satisfaction)

**Your Task:**

1. Review the **RetailFlow case study** in your packet
2. Complete the **Pilot Scoping Worksheet** as a group
3. Define: Scope, metrics, risks, budget, timeline
4. Make it "Goldilocks perfect" - not too big, not too small

**Then... a surprise constraint will change everything**

- "All materials are in your participant packet"
- "Turn to the Pilot Scoping section"
- "You have 30 minutes to complete the worksheet"
- "One person should be scribe, but everyone contributes"
- Set 30-minute timer
- After 20 minutes: Give 10-minute warning
- After 30 minutes: Distribute ONE random constraint card per group
- "You now have 10 minutes to adapt your plan based on this constraint"

# Exercise: Crisis Management Simulation

![](./images/crisis-storm-timeline.png)

::: {.notes}
- "This is the centerpiece of the day"
- "The Scenario: You're 2 months into the RetailFlow chatbot pilot. Week 2 of live deployment."
- "You will face 4 crises, each one different"
- "Crisis 1: Data Quality Disaster - Technical failure, AI giving wrong answers"
- "Crisis 2: Staff Resistance - People problem, team actively sabotaging"
- "Crisis 3: Executive Pressure - Leadership challenge, sponsor demands acceleration"
- "Crisis 4: Ethical Dilemma - Values decision, AI works but discriminates"
- "Work through each crisis sequentially in your groups"
- "You'll experience what AI project crises FEEL like"
- "Some involve role-plays with me - I'll come to your table"
- "Diagnose, decide, communicate - under time pressure"
- "Let's begin with Crisis 1 - Data Quality Disaster"

# Exercise: Scale or Kill Decisions


![](./images/scale-pivot-kill-decision-tree.png)

::: {.notes}

**Three Cases**

A: High ROI (but...)
B: Destroyed morale
C: Revenue up, satisfaction down

**Your Call: SCALE • PIVOT • KILL**

- "Now you shift from tactical to strategic thinking"
- "You'll analyse three AI projects and make recommendations"
- "Case A: Clear Success - inventory AI with 733% ROI (but is it straightforward?)"
- "Case B: Clear Failure - scheduling AI that destroyed morale (but learn from it)"
- "Case C: Ambiguous - pricing AI, good revenue but bad customer satisfaction (no perfect answer)"
- "For each case, recommend: SCALE, PIVOT, or KILL"
- "Defend your decision with evidence and reasoning"
- "Use your Decision Framework reference sheet"
- "You have 60 minutes total"
:::

# Personal Reflection

::: {.notes}
- "This is the most important part of the day"
- "You've experienced a lot - now make it personal"
- "Think about YOUR projects, YOUR challenges, YOUR context"
- "What's the ONE thing you'll do differently starting Monday?"
- "This is required for CRL, so complete it thoughtfully"
