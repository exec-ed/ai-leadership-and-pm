# Module 5: Ethical AI Leadership
## Making Values-Based Decisions in AI Projects

---

## üéØ MODULE OVERVIEW

### What You'll Learn
- **Apply four-question framework** for ethical decision-making
- **Navigate competing priorities** using values hierarchy
- **Conduct systematic ethical impact assessment**
- **Integrate ethics throughout AI project lifecycle**

### Why This Matters
AI projects don't just automate processes‚Äîthey embed values, make decisions that affect people's lives, and can reinforce or reduce existing inequities. **As a project leader, you're responsible for ensuring your AI projects serve your organization's values and societal good**, not just technical goals.

## üé≠ ETHICAL DILEMMA SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Accuracy vs. Fairness Trade-off

**Situation:** Your AI hiring system achieves 95% overall accuracy but shows significant bias against certain demographic groups. You can improve fairness but doing so would reduce overall accuracy to 85%.

**Ethical Conflict:**
- **Efficiency vs. Equity:** Higher accuracy vs. fair treatment
- **Business Impact vs. Social Responsibility:** Better hiring outcomes vs. discrimination
- **Stakeholder Interests:** Company needs vs. applicant rights

**Decision Framework Application:**
1. **Who benefits?** Company gets better hires, but some groups are disadvantaged
2. **What could go wrong?** Legal challenges, reputational damage, perpetuation of inequality
3. **How do we know it's working?** Monitor both accuracy and fairness metrics
4. **When do we stop?** When fairness falls below acceptable thresholds

**Discussion Questions:**
- What level of accuracy trade-off is acceptable for fairness?
- How do you balance business needs with ethical obligations?
- Who should decide the acceptable trade-off point?
- How do you communicate this decision to different stakeholders?

### Scenario 2: Privacy vs. Public Health

**Situation:** During a public health crisis, your AI system could identify at-risk individuals using personal health data, but doing so would violate privacy expectations and potentially legal requirements.

**Ethical Conflict:**
- **Individual Rights vs. Public Good:** Privacy protection vs. health protection
- **Legal Compliance vs. Emergency Response:** Following laws vs. saving lives
- **Short-term vs. Long-term:** Immediate crisis vs. long-term trust erosion

**Decision Framework Application:**
1. **Who benefits?** Public health benefits, but individual privacy is compromised
2. **What could go wrong?** Loss of public trust, legal challenges, mission creep
3. **How do we know it's working?** Health outcomes improve while minimizing privacy violations
4. **When do we stop?** When emergency ends or privacy violations become excessive

**Discussion Questions:**
- When is it acceptable to violate privacy for public good?
- How do you ensure temporary measures don't become permanent?
- What safeguards are needed to prevent abuse?
- How do you maintain trust while making these decisions?

### Scenario 3: Transparency vs. Security

**Situation:** Explaining how your AI security system works could help attackers bypass those security measures. Full transparency would improve trust but reduce security effectiveness.

**Ethical Conflict:**
- **Openness vs. Protection:** Transparency vs. security
- **Short-term Trust vs. Long-term Safety:** Immediate trust vs. ongoing protection
- **Stakeholder Knowledge vs. System Vulnerability:** User understanding vs. attacker advantage

**Decision Framework Application:**
1. **Who benefits?** Users benefit from understanding, but attackers benefit from knowledge
2. **What could go wrong?** Security breaches, system exploitation, user harm
3. **How do we know it's working?** System remains secure while maintaining appropriate transparency
4. **When do we stop?** When transparency creates unacceptable security risks

**Discussion Questions:**
- How much transparency is required for ethical AI?
- What level of security risk is acceptable for transparency?
- How do you balance different stakeholder needs?
- What alternative approaches could resolve this conflict?
