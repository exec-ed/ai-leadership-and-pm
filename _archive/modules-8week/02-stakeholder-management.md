## üìä POWER-INTEREST STAKEHOLDER MAPPING

### The Framework

```
         HIGH POWER
               |
     KEEP      |      MANAGE
   SATISFIED   |      CLOSELY
               |
--------------+-------------- HIGH INTEREST
               |
    MONITOR    |       KEEP
               |     INFORMED
               |
