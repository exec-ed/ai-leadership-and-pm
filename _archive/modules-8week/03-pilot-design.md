# Module 3: Pilot Design and Execution
## The Goldilocks Principle for Optimal Pilot Scoping

---

## üéØ MODULE OVERVIEW

### What You'll Learn
- **Apply the Goldilocks principle** for optimal pilot scoping
- **Define success metrics** beyond technical measures
- **Conduct comprehensive risk assessment** and mitigation planning
- **Design learning-focused pilots** for maximum insight and value

### Why This Matters
Most AI projects fail at the pilot stage‚Äînot because of technical issues, but because pilots are either too small (learn nothing) or too big (guaranteed failure). **Effective pilot design is the foundation of AI project success** and determines whether you can scale with confidence.

## ü•ò THE GOLDILOCKS PRINCIPLE

### Why Pilot Scope Matters

**Too Small (Learn Nothing):**
- Limited business value demonstrated
- No meaningful metrics or insights
- Too narrow to prove AI value proposition
- Easy wins that don't translate to real applications
- Stakeholders lose interest due to limited impact

**Too Big (Guaranteed Failure):**
- Automating everything at once
- No clear success metrics or boundaries
- Changing multiple processes simultaneously
- Insufficient time for testing and iteration
- Complexity overwhelms learning objectives

**Just Right (Prove Value & Learn):**
- Single business problem with clear metrics
- Manageable technical scope and complexity
- Clear pilot boundaries and success criteria
- Visible success that can scale and inspire confidence
- Rich learning opportunities for future expansion

### The Goldilocks Framework

```
SCOPE DIMENSIONS

Business Scope:
Too Small ‚Üí Limited impact, no stakeholder interest
Just Right ‚Üí Clear value, measurable impact
Too Big ‚Üí Multiple objectives, unclear success

Technical Scope:
Too Small ‚Üí Simple problems, no learning
Just Right ‚Üí Manageable complexity, real challenges
Too Big ‚Üí Integration nightmares, technical debt

Timeline Scope:
Too Small ‚Üí No time for learning or iteration
Just Right ‚Üí Sufficient time for testing and refinement
Too Big ‚Üí Too long to maintain momentum and interest

Stakeholder Scope:
Too Small ‚Üí Limited buy-in, no champions
Just Right ‚Üí Key stakeholders engaged and invested
Too Big ‚Üí Too many opinions, decision paralysis
```

### Success Metrics Must Be Comprehensive
- **Technical metrics alone** are insufficient for pilot success
- **Business impact** is the ultimate measure of success
- **User adoption** determines whether solutions will scale
- **Organizational learning** creates value beyond the pilot

### Risk Management is Essential
- **AI pilots have unique risks** beyond traditional projects
