---

#### **Slide 4: Why This Masterclass is Different**
**Two columns comparison:**

| **Traditional Masterclass** | **Today's Approach** |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| 6 hours of lecture | 1 hour lecture, 5 hours practice |
| Take notes | Make decisions |
| Passive learning | Active problem-solving |
| Remember 10% | Apply 90% |
| Theory | Experience |

**Speaker Notes:**
- "You already know how to take notes"
- "Today you'll experience what AI project leadership FEELS like"
- "The crises you'll face are based on real projects"
- "Some of you will feel uncomfortable - that's where learning happens"

---

#### **Slide 5: The Brutal Truth About AI Projects**
**Big bold statistic in center:**

# 80%
**of AI projects fail to deliver value**

**Source:** Gartner, 2023

**Below statistic:**
**Technical Issues: 20%**  
- Algorithm doesn't work, Data quality problems, Infrastructure failures

**People & Organizational Issues: 80%**  
- Stakeholder resistance, Unclear objectives, Poor change management, Ethical oversights, Wrong metrics, Scope creep

**Speaker Notes:**
- "Let that sink in - 4 out of 5 AI projects fail"
- "Not because technology doesn't work..."
- "AI project leadership is NOT primarily about technology"
- "It's about people, politics, and change"
- "That's what we're focusing on today"

---

#### **Slide 6: Real AI Project Failures**
**Three brief case examples (icons + text):**

**üè• Healthcare AI Diagnostic Tool**
- $5M investment, 2-year development, 95% accuracy in lab testing
- **FAILED:** Clinicians didn't trust it, refused to use it
- **Lesson:** Forgot about user adoption

**üè™ Retail Inventory AI**
- Reduced stockouts by 40% (success!)
- **FAILED:** Automated away jobs, union backlash, PR disaster
- **Lesson:** Didn't manage people impact

**üí∞ Bank Loan Approval AI**
- Improved processing speed by 70%
- **FAILED:** Discriminated against protected groups
- **Lesson:** Ethical oversight missing

**Speaker Notes:**
- "These are real projects (anonymized)"
- "All had solid technology"
- "All failed because of people and process issues"
- "Today you'll practice navigating exactly these challenges"

---

#### **Slide 7: Traditional Projects vs. AI Projects**
**Two-column comparison table:**

| **Traditional Project** | **AI Project** |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Requirements known upfront | Requirements emerge through experimentation |
| Linear progression | Iterative, hypothesis-driven |
| Success criteria clear | Success criteria evolve |
| Predictable timeline | "We'll know more after pilot" |
| Technical risk primary | Organizational risk dominant |
| Implementation focus | Learning & adaptation focus |
| Gantt charts rule | Experiments rule |

**Speaker Notes:**
- "Many of you have led successful traditional projects"
- "AI projects require DIFFERENT skills"
- "Not better or worse - different"
- "Today we focus on what's unique about AI leadership"

---

#### **Slide 8: The AI Project Lifecycle**
**Visual diagram - circular flow:**

```
IDEATION ‚Üí SCOPING ‚Üí PILOT ‚Üí EVALUATION ‚Üí DECISION
                                                ‚Üì
                                    SCALE / PIVOT / KILL
```

**Each phase highlighted:**
- **Ideation:** Identify opportunity
- **Scoping:** Define pilot boundaries  
- **Pilot:** Build and test at small scale
- **Evaluation:** Measure results rigorously
- **Decision:** Scale, Pivot, or Kill

**Speaker Notes:**
- "Most organizations rush through Scoping"
- "Most fail at Evaluation (don't measure the right things)"
- "Most struggle with Kill decision (sunk cost fallacy)"
- "Today you'll practice the hardest parts: Scoping, Crisis Management, and Scale/Kill decisions"

---

#### **Slide 9: Introducing "Humans in the Loop" Framework**
**Title:** Beyond Technology: Humans in the Loop  
**Subtitle:** The Leadership Framework for AI Project Success

**Visual:** Diagram showing AI technology surrounded by humans (stakeholders, users, leaders)

**The Core Principle:**
"AI projects aren't about replacing humans with technology.  
They're about designing new ways for humans and AI to work together."

**Three Pillars:**
1. **Stakeholder Orchestration** - Align diverse interests and motivations
2. **Change Navigation** - Guide organizations through AI transformation
3. **Ethical Leadership** - Make values-based decisions under uncertainty

**Speaker Notes:**
- "This is framework we'll use throughout today"
- "It has three pillars - not fluffy, mission-critical"
- "These pillars will help you navigate every exercise today"

---

#### **Slide 10: Meet RetailFlow**
**Company logo/image**

**RetailFlow: Regional Retail Chain**
- 50 stores across Australia
- $150M annual revenue
- 2,000 employees
- Mix of physical + e-commerce

**Their Challenge:**
Customer satisfaction dropping (78% ‚Üí 68%)  
Response times too slow (26 hours avg)

**11:45am - 12:30pm**

**Objective:** Design a well-scoped AI pilot for RetailFlow

**The Challenge:**  
RetailFlow's customer service is broken (26-hour response times, 68% satisfaction)

**Your Task (30 minutes):**
1. Review the **RetailFlow case study** in your packet
2. Complete the **Pilot Scoping Worksheet** as a group
3. Define: Scope, metrics, risks, budget, timeline
4. Make it "Goldilocks perfect" - not too big, not too small

**Then... a surprise constraint will change everything**

**Speaker Notes:**
- "All materials are in your participant packet"
- "Turn to the Pilot Scoping section"
- "You have 30 minutes to complete the worksheet"
- "One person should be scribe, but everyone contributes"
- Set 30-minute timer

1. **Crisis 1:** Data Quality Disaster (20 min)  
   *Technical failure - AI giving wrong answers*

2. **Crisis 2:** Staff Resistance (25 min)  
   *People problem - team actively sabotaging*

3. **Crisis 3:** Executive Pressure (25 min)  
   *Leadership challenge - sponsor demands acceleration*

---

### **CLOSING SESSION: STRATEGIC DECISIONS & SYNTHESIS**

---

#### **Slide 17: Exercise 4 - Scale or Kill Decisions**
**3:00pm - 4:00pm**

**Objective:** Make strategic recommendations on AI projects

**You have 3 case studies:**
- **Case A:** Clear Success (inventory AI with 733% ROI)
- **Case B:** Clear Failure (scheduling AI that destroyed morale)
- **Case C:** Ambiguous One (pricing AI - good revenue, bad customer satisfaction)

**Your Task:**
For each case, recommend: **SCALE**, **PIVOT**, or **KILL**  
Defend your decision with evidence and reasoning

**Use your Decision Framework reference sheet**

**Speaker Notes:**
- "Now you shift from tactical to strategic thinking"

---

#### **Slide 20: Key Learning Highlights**
**What makes this different from traditional project management:**

**üéØ Core Insights:**
- **AI projects fail from people issues, not technology (80% vs 20%)**
- **Stakeholder orchestration is more critical than technical excellence**
- **No plan survives first contact with reality - flexibility matters**
- **Ethical decisions aren't optional - they're leadership responsibilities**
- **Killing bad projects is success, not failure**

**üîÑ Decision Principles:**
- **Data-driven decisions are good, values-driven decisions are essential**
- **The cost of being wrong about scaling is much higher than cost of being wrong about killing**
- **When in doubt, run another small experiment rather than scaling prematurely**

**üöÄ Monday Morning Actions:**
- **Map your stakeholders** using the power-interest matrix
- **Define success metrics** beyond just technical measures
- **Identify your top 3 risks** and mitigation strategies
- **Practice one difficult conversation** before you need to have it

**Speaker Notes:**
- "These aren't just things you heard - they're things you PRACTICED"
- "You experienced stakeholder resistance firsthand"
- "You made tough decisions under pressure"
- "You navigated ethical dilemmas with no perfect answers"
- "You have muscle memory now, not just theory"
