## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Ethical AI Leadership**
*Making Values-Based Decisions in AI Projects*

Module 5 - Leadership and PM Executive Course

---

## Slide 2: Why Ethical Leadership Matters
**AI Projects Embed Values**

AI projects don't just automate processesâ€”they:
- **Embed values** into automated decisions
- **Make decisions** that affect people's lives
- **Can reinforce or reduce** existing inequities
- **Create impact** beyond technical requirements

**Key Insight:** As a project leader, you're responsible for ensuring your AI projects serve your organization's values and societal good, not just technical goals.

## Slide 3: The Four Question Framework
**Ethical Decision-Making Guide**

Before any major AI project decision, ask:

**1. WHO benefits from this AI?**
- Who wins? Who loses?
- Are benefits distributed fairly?
- Who might be disproportionately harmed?
- Who was included in design process?

**2. WHAT could go wrong?**
- Bias, discrimination, privacy issues
- Safety concerns, unintended consequences
- What's worst-case scenario?
- Who bears the risk if something goes wrong?

**3. HOW do we know it's working?**
- What are we measuring?
- Are we measuring the right things?
- How do we detect unintended harms?
- Who decides what "success" means?

**4. WHEN do we stop?**
- What's our red line/kill switch?
- What would make us pause or terminate?
- What are our non-negotiable values?

---

## Slide 4: The Values Hierarchy
**Prioritizing When Values Conflict**

**Level 1: Non-Negotiable**
- Human safety and wellbeing
- Legal compliance
- Fundamental human rights
- Truth and accuracy

**Level 2: Core Values**
- Fairness and equity
- Privacy and autonomy
- Transparency and explainability
- Accountability and responsibility

**Level 3: Strategic Values**
- Innovation and progress
- Efficiency and productivity
- Competitive advantage
- Organizational growth

**Guiding Principle:** When values conflict, prioritize higher levels over lower levels.

---

## Slide 5: Common Ethical Challenges
**Bias and Fairness**

**Types of Bias:**
- **Selection bias:** Training data doesn't represent target population
- **Measurement bias:** How we measure outcomes reflects existing inequities
- **Algorithmic bias:** Model learns and amplifies historical patterns
- **Deployment bias:** How AI is used in practice creates new inequities

**Detection Strategies:**
- **Audit training data** for representation and quality
- **Test across demographic groups** for performance differences
- **Monitor outcomes** for disparate impact
- **Involve diverse stakeholders** in testing and validation

---

## Slide 6: Common Ethical Challenges
**Privacy and Data Rights**

**Key Questions:**
- **Consent:** Did people agree to this use of their data?
- **Purpose limitation:** Are we using data only for agreed purposes?
- **Data minimization:** Are we collecting only what's necessary?
- **Transparency:** Do people know how their data is used?

**Protection Strategies:**
- **Data governance frameworks** with clear ownership and rules
- **Privacy impact assessments** before data collection
- **Anonymization and aggregation** where possible
- **Clear data retention and deletion policies**

---

## Slide 7: Common Ethical Challenges
**Transparency and Explainability**

**Why It Matters:**
- **Trust:** People need to understand decisions affecting them
- **Accountability:** We need to explain and justify outcomes
- **Debugging:** We need to understand why things go wrong
- **Compliance:** Regulations often require explanation

**Levels of Explainability:**
- **Global:** How does the system work overall?
- **Local:** Why did it make this specific decision?
- **Counterfactual:** What would need to change for a different outcome?
- **Causal:** What factors actually caused the outcome?

---

## Slide 8: Ethical Review Process
**Phase 1: Project Initiation**

- **Ethical impact assessment** - identify potential harms and benefits
- **Stakeholder analysis** - who might be affected
- **Values alignment check** - does this align with organizational values?
- **Risk assessment** - what could go wrong ethically?

**Phase 2: Development**

- **Data ethics review** - is data collection and use appropriate?
- **Bias testing** - are we building in unfairness?
- **Privacy review** - are we protecting people's rights?
- **Transparency planning** - how will we explain decisions?

**Phase 3: Deployment**

- **Ethical testing** - real-world validation of ethical concerns
- **Monitoring setup** - how will we detect ethical issues?
- **Governance structure** - who makes ethical decisions?
- **Response planning** - what do we do when ethical issues arise?

**Phase 4: Operation**

- **Ongoing monitoring** - continuous ethical oversight
- **Regular audits** - systematic review of ethical performance
- **Stakeholder feedback** - channels for concerns and complaints
- **Adaptive management** - adjusting based on ethical learning

## Slide 9: Ethical Decision-Making Framework
**Step-by-Step Process**

**Step 1: Identify Ethical Dimension**

- Who might be harmed or benefited?
- What are the ethical stakes?

**Step 2: Gather Multiple Perspectives**
- Technical team perspective
- Business stakeholder perspective
- End-user perspective
- Societal/ethical expert perspective

**Step 3: Evaluate Options**
- Option A: Proceed as planned
- Option B: Modify approach
- Option C: Pause and reconsider
- Option D: Cancel project

**Step 4: Make and Document Decision**
- What decision was made and why?
- What ethical principles guided the decision?
- What monitoring and safeguards are needed?
- How will we communicate the decision?
