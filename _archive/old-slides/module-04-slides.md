## Slide 2: Why Crisis Response Matters
**AI Projects Create Unique Crises**

**Traditional Project Crises:**
- Budget overruns and schedule delays
- Technical failures and integration issues
- Resource shortages and team conflicts
- Scope changes and requirement creep

**AI Project Crises:**
- Algorithmic bias and discrimination
- Data quality and privacy breaches
- Unexpected AI behavior and decisions
- Ethical dilemmas and value conflicts
- Trust and reputation damage
- Regulatory and compliance violations

**Key Insight:** How you respond in crisis moments determines project survival and organizational trust. Crisis response is not just problem-solving; it's leadership under pressure.
