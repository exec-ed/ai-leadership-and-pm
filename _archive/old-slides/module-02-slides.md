## Slide 2: Why Stakeholder Management Matters
**AI Projects Transform Organizations**

**Traditional Projects:**
- Clear boundaries and defined scope
- Limited impact on day-to-day work
- Stakeholders concerned with deliverables
- Success measured by meeting specifications

**AI Projects:**
- Blurry boundaries and evolving scope
- Transformative impact on how work gets done
- Stakeholders concerned with jobs, ethics, and change
- Success measured by business value and transformation

**Key Insight:** Stakeholder management is the single most critical factor in AI project success.

## Slide 3: The Stakeholder Complexity Matrix
**Four Types of AI Project Stakeholders**

**Technical Stakeholders:**
- Data scientists and ML engineers
- IT infrastructure and security teams
- Integration specialists and architects
- Quality assurance and testing teams

**Business Stakeholders:**
- Executive sponsors and business unit leaders
- Process owners and operations managers
- Finance and procurement teams
- Legal and compliance departments

**End User Stakeholders:**

## Slide 4: Power-Interest Stakeholder Mapping
**Strategic Framework for Engagement**

```
          HIGH POWER
                |
      KEEP      |      MANAGE
    SATISFIED   |      CLOSELY
                |
 --------------+-------------- HIGH INTEREST
                |
     MONITOR    |       KEEP
                |     INFORMED
                |
          LOW POWER
```

---

## Slide 5: Understanding the Quadrants
**Engagement Strategies by Quadrant**

**Manage Closely (High Power, High Interest):**
- **Who:** Executive sponsors, key business leaders, regulatory authorities
- **Strategy:** Frequent engagement, decision rights, involve in key decisions
- **Risk:** Losing their support can kill your project

**Keep Satisfied (High Power, Low Interest):**
- **Who:** C-level executives not directly involved, IT leadership, legal department
- **Strategy:** Regular updates, address concerns proactively, show appreciation
- **Risk:** If they become interested, they may move to "Manage Closely"

**Keep Informed (Low Power, High Interest):**
- **Who:** End users, subject matter experts, customer advocates
- **Strategy:** Transparent communication, provide information without overloading
- **Risk:** Can become powerful allies or organized resistance

**Monitor (Low Power, Low Interest):**
- **Who:** General employees, peripheral departments, external observers
- **Strategy:** Track from distance, minimal interaction, stay aware
- **Risk:** Can become interested if project affects them unexpectedly
