## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Pilot Design and Execution**
*The Goldilocks Principle for Optimal Pilot Scoping*

Module 3 - Leadership and PM Executive Course

## Slide 2: Why Pilot Design Matters
**Most AI Projects Fail at the Pilot Stage**

Not because of technical issues, but because pilots are:
- **Too Small:** Learn nothing meaningful
- **Too Big:** Guaranteed failure due to complexity
- **Just Right:** Prove value and learn for scaling

**Key Insight:** Effective pilot design is the foundation of AI project success and determines whether you can scale with confidence.

---

## Slide 3: The Goldilocks Principle
**Finding the "Just Right" Scope**

**Too Small (Learn Nothing):**
- Limited business value demonstrated
- No meaningful metrics or insights
- Too narrow to prove AI value proposition
- Easy wins that don't translate to real applications
- Stakeholders lose interest due to limited impact

**Too Big (Guaranteed Failure):**
- Automating everything at once
- No clear success metrics or boundaries
- Changing multiple processes simultaneously
- Insufficient time for testing and iteration
- Complexity overwhelms learning objectives

**Just Right (Prove Value & Learn):**
- Single business problem with clear metrics
- Manageable technical scope and complexity
- Clear pilot boundaries and success criteria
- Visible success that can scale and inspire confidence
- Rich learning opportunities for future expansion

## Slide 4: The Goldilocks Framework
**Scope Dimensions**

```
SCOPE DIMENSIONS

Business Scope:
Too Small → Limited impact, no stakeholder interest
Just Right → Clear value, measurable impact
Too Big → Multiple objectives, unclear success

Technical Scope:
Too Small → Simple problems, no learning
Just Right → Manageable complexity, real challenges
Too Big → Integration nightmares, technical debt

Timeline Scope:
Too Small → No time for learning or iteration
Just Right → Sufficient time for testing and refinement
Too Big → Too long to maintain momentum and interest

Stakeholder Scope:
Too Small → Limited buy-in, no champions
Just Right → Key stakeholders engaged and invested
Too Big → Too many opinions, decision paralysis
```

- Scope determines learning potential and success probability
- Too small pilots waste time and resources with minimal insight
- Too big pilots almost always fail due to complexity
- Just right pilots balance learning with value demonstration

**Success Metrics Must Be Comprehensive**
- Technical metrics alone are insufficient for pilot success
- Business impact is the ultimate measure of success
- User adoption determines whether solutions will scale
- Organizational learning creates value beyond the pilot

**Risk Management is Essential**
- AI pilots have unique risks beyond traditional projects
- Early risk identification prevents pilot failure
- Mitigation strategies must be practical and actionable
- Monitoring and adaptation are essential for risk management
