## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Foundations of AI Project Leadership**
*Why AI Projects Fail and How Leadership Prevents Failure*

Module 1 - Leadership and PM Executive Course

---

## Slide 2: The Shocking Reality
**80% of AI Projects Fail**

But here's what's surprising:
- ❌ Only 20% of failures are technical
- ✅ 80% are due to people, process, and organizational issues
- ✅ Technical teams usually deliver what they're asked to build
- ❌ The problem is building the wrong thing or building it the wrong way

---

## Slide 3: Real Failure Reasons
**Why AI Projects Actually Fail**

1. **Stakeholder Resistance (35%)**
   - People don't want to use or support the AI

2. **Unclear Objectives (25%)**
   - No one agrees on what success looks like

3. **Poor Change Management (20%)**
   - Organization isn't prepared for transformation

4. **Ethical Oversights (15%)**
   - Trust issues, bias, or unintended consequences

5. **Integration Challenges (5%)**
   - AI doesn't fit with existing systems

## Slide 4: The Leadership Gap
**Traditional Project Management vs. AI Project Leadership**

| Traditional PM | AI Project Leadership |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Deliver technical specifications | Deliver business value and transformation |
| Manage scope, schedule, budget | Navigate complex stakeholder landscapes |
| Report status to stakeholders | Build coalitions and manage resistance |
| Close when deliverables complete | Ensure lasting organizational impact |

---

## Slide 5: The Mindset Shift
**From Manager to Strategic Leader**

**Technical Manager Mindset:**
- "How do we build this AI system?"
- "Are we on schedule and budget?"
- "Did we meet technical requirements?"
- "Project is done when we deliver software"

**Strategic Leader Mindset:**
- "Should we build this AI system?"
- "Are we creating real business value?"
- "Are we transforming how work gets done?"
- "Project succeeds when organization is transformed"
