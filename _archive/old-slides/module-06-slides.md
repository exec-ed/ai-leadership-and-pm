*From Pilot Success to Organizational Impact*

Module 6 - Leadership and PM Executive Course

## Slide 2: Why Scaling Matters
**The Scaling Challenge**

Most AI projects fail at the scaling stage. A successful pilot:
- ✅ **Proves concept viability**
- ❌ **Doesn't guarantee scaling success**

**Scaling Requires Different Capabilities:**
- **Technical:** Architecture, reliability, integration
- **Organizational:** Change management, stakeholder alignment
- **Business:** Updated business case, resource planning

**Key Insight:** Your ability to navigate the pilot-to-production transition determines whether your AI project delivers lasting organizational value.

---

## Slide 3: Evaluating Pilot Success
**Beyond Technical Metrics**

**Technical Performance (Table Stakes):**
- Accuracy, reliability, speed meet requirements
- System stability and error rates acceptable
- Integration with existing systems works
- Technical debt is manageable

**Business Impact (The Real Test):**
- ROI projections are being met or exceeded
- Business processes are actually improving
- Customer/employee experience is better
- Competitive advantage is being created

**Organizational Readiness (The Hidden Factor):**
- Stakeholders actively support expansion
- End users want to continue using system
- Clear ownership and maintenance plans exist
- Team has capability to support at scale

**Strategic Alignment (The Long View):**
- Supports broader organizational strategy
- Creates platform for future AI initiatives
- Builds organizational AI capabilities
- Positions organization for market leadership

## Slide 4: The Success Evaluation Matrix
**Making Scale/Pivot/Kill Decisions**

```
                HIGH
                |
    SCALE       |     PIVOT
                |
                +-------------- BUSINESS IMPACT
                |
    KILL        |     EXTEND
                |
                LOW
                |
           TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE
```

**Quadrant Decisions:**
- **Scale:** Strong technical performance AND business impact
- **Pivot:** Strong technical performance but weak business impact
- **Extend:** Weak technical performance but strong business impact
- **Kill:** Weak technical performance AND business impact

---

## Slide 5: When to SCALE IT
**Clear Indicators for Scaling**

**Financial Indicators:**
- ROI > 200% in first year of operation
- Benefits exceed costs by significant margin
- Costs to scale are predictable and manageable
- Business case strengthens rather than weakens at scale

**Technical Performance:**
- System reliability > 95% in production
- Accuracy meets or exceeds targets consistently
- Can integrate with existing enterprise systems
- Maintenance requirements are sustainable

**Organizational Readiness:**
- Stakeholders actively champion expansion
- End users resist going back to old processes
- Clear ownership and maintenance funding secured
- Team has capability and capacity to support

**User Impact:**
- Measurable improvement in customer/employee experience
- Satisfaction metrics improving or stable high
- No significant ethical or safety concerns
- Complaints are minor and manageable

---

## Slide 6: When to PIVOT IT
**Strategic Course Correction**

**Wrong Scope:**
- Pilot too narrow → Expand scope
- Pilot too broad → Narrow focus
- Wrong problem identified → Retarget to different problem
- Wrong success metrics → Change evaluation criteria

**Wrong Approach:**
- Autonomous AI failing → Try human-AI collaboration
- Real-time processing not needed → Batch processing
- Complex solution overkill → Simplify approach
- Technology choice wrong → Change underlying technology

**Wrong Audience:**
- Built for wrong users → Redesign for different user group
- Executive sponsorship misaligned → Find new champion
- Deployment context wrong → Change implementation setting
- Value proposition unclear → Reframe benefits

**Wrong Timing:**
- Market not ready → Pause and restart when ready
- Organization not prepared → Invest in change management
- Technology not mature → Wait or choose different approach
- Regulatory environment unclear → Wait for clarity

---

## Slide 7: When to KILL IT
**Knowing When to Stop**

**Financial Red Flags:**
- ROI is negative or marginal with no improvement path
- Costs exceed benefits even in best-case scenarios
- Opportunity cost too high (better uses for resources)
- Business case deteriorates rather than improves

**Technical Blockers:**
- Fundamental technical limitations that can't be overcome
- "It just doesn't work" despite multiple iterations
- Required accuracy/performance is unachievable
- Integration complexity makes maintenance impossible

**Organizational Resistance:**
- Widespread, persistent resistance that won't budge
- Creating more organizational problems than solving
- No one wants to own or maintain solution
- Key sponsor has withdrawn support

**User Harm:**
- Actively harming customer or employee experience
- Significant ethical issues that can't be mitigated
- Brand or trust damage occurring
- Safety or regulatory risks materializing

## Slide 17: Role-Play Scenario 1
**The Scaling Dilemma**

**Situation:** Your pilot shows 70% accuracy (below 80% target) but users love it and business impact is strong. Your technical team wants to improve accuracy before scaling, but business stakeholders want to expand now.

**Your Challenge:** Do you scale, pivot, or pause?

**Discussion Points:**
- How do you evaluate trade-offs between technical perfection and business value?
- What are the risks of scaling with known technical limitations?
- How do you manage stakeholder expectations while maintaining technical integrity?
- What mitigation strategies could enable scaling while addressing technical concerns?

---

## Slide 18: Role-Play Scenario 2
**The Resource Allocation Conflict**

**Situation:** You have funding to scale either Project A (strong technical performance, moderate business impact) or Project B (moderate technical performance, strong business impact), but not both.

**Your Challenge:** Which project do you choose and how do you communicate the decision?

**Discussion Points:**
- What criteria should guide resource allocation decisions?
- How do you balance technical excellence with business impact?
- How do you communicate difficult decisions to project teams?
- What strategies can you use to maintain morale of teams not selected?

---

## Slide 19: Role-Play Scenario 3
**The Organizational Resistance Crisis**

**Situation:** Your pilot was technically successful and showed good business impact, but a key department is refusing to adopt the scaled solution, claiming it disrupts their workflows.

**Your Challenge:** How do you address this resistance while maintaining scaling timeline?

**Discussion Points:**
- What are the root causes of organizational resistance?
- How do you balance standardization with local adaptation needs?
- What strategies can overcome entrenched resistance?
- When do you accommodate resistance vs. push through despite it?

- Organizational readiness is as important as technical readiness
- Stakeholder management becomes more complex at scale
- Change management is critical, not optional

**Decision Frameworks Guide Success:**
- Evidence-based decisions reduce bias and improve outcomes
- Clear criteria make difficult decisions more defensible
- Multiple options (scale/pivot/kill) provide flexibility
- Systematic evaluation ensures important factors aren't overlooked

**Planning and Preparation Matter:**
- Scaling roadmaps provide structure and reduce risk
- Phased approaches allow learning and adjustment
- Comprehensive preparation prevents common scaling failures
- Ongoing monitoring enables course correction
