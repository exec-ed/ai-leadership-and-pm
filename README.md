## Key Materials by Activity

### Activity 1: Pilot Scoping
- **Case:** Scoping exercise worksheet
- **Cards:** Constraint cards (budget-cut, scope-creep, timeline-acceleration, vendor-lock-in)
- **Handout:** Project scoping framework
- **Instructor guide:** `instructor-materials/activity-1-pilot-scoping/`

### Activity 2: Speed-Dating (Stakeholder Conversations)
- **Cards:** 6 stakeholder role cards (CEO, CFO, Data Scientist, CS Manager, IT Security, End User)
- **Handout:** Stakeholder mapping template
- **Instructor guide:** `instructor-materials/activity-2-speed-dating/`

### Activity 3: Crisis Management
- **Cards:** Crisis cards (data-quality, team-resistance, executive-pressure, ethical-dilemma)
- **Handout:** Crisis response framework (DDCD)
- **Instructor guide:** `instructor-materials/activity-3-crisis-management/`

### Activity 4: Scale/Pivot/Kill
- **Data:** Pilot metrics dashboard (accessed via RetailFlow internal portal)
- **Handout:** Scale/Pivot/Kill decision framework
- **Instructor guide:** `instructor-materials/activity-4-scale-pivot-kill/`

---

## Building the Website

### Generate all materials
```bash
./scripts/render-all.sh
```

This renders all `.qmd` files to HTML and PDF, then organizes them into the `docs/` folder.

**What gets rendered:**
- Student materials → `docs/activities/`, `docs/handouts/`
- Instructor materials → `docs/instructor/`
- Slides → `docs/content/`
- Pre-readings → `docs/pre-readings/`

### Test locally
```bash
open docs/index.html
```

### Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Ensure `docs/` folder is committed to git
2. GitHub Pages settings: Deploy from `main` branch, `/docs` folder
3. Site will be live at: `https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]/`

## Important Notes

### Constraint Cards vs Crisis Cards

**CONSTRAINT CARDS** (`/activities/materials/constraint-cards/`)
- Used in: Activity 1 (Pilot Scoping)
- Represent: Planning challenges BEFORE pilot starts
- Examples: Budget cuts, scope creep, timeline pressure, vendor constraints
- Files: `budget-cut.qmd`, `scope-creep.qmd`, `timeline-acceleration.qmd`, `vendor-lock-in.qmd`

**CRISIS CARDS** (`/activities/materials/crisis-cards/`)
- Used in: Activity 3 (Crisis Management)
- Represent: Issues that arise DURING live pilot
- Examples: Data quality, team resistance, executive pressure, ethical dilemmas
- Files: `data-quality.qmd`, `team-resistance.qmd`, `executive-pressure.qmd`, `ethical-dilemma.qmd`

**Don't mix them up!** Constraints are for planning; crises are for simulation.

### Student Materials vs Instructor Materials

**Student materials** (concise, 1-2 pages):
- Location: `/handouts/` and `/activities/materials/`
- Purpose: Quick reference during and after course
- Access: Via companion website Resources menu

**Instructor materials** (detailed, 10+ pages):
- Location: `/instructor-materials/` (organized by activity)
- Purpose: Facilitation guides, sample answers, teaching notes
- Access: Via instructor portal (password-protected)

Both exist for the same frameworks, just different detail levels.

### Instructor Portal

**Access:** Click "🔐 Instructor" in companion site navigation
**Password:** `instructor2025`

**What's included:**
- Facilitator quick reference (PRINT THIS!)
- Activity facilitation guides (all 4 activities)
- Framework walkthroughs
- Sample answers and assessment rubrics
- Feedback from previous deliveries

### RetailFlow Case Study

**Main site:** [retailflow.serveur.au](https://retailflow.serveur.au)
- Company overview, staff bios, products
- Provides context for all activities

**Internal portal:** [retailflow.serveur.au/internal](https://retailflow.serveur.au/internal)
- Password: `pilot2024`
- Contains Week 6 pilot data dashboard
- Used in Activity 4 (Scale/Pivot/Kill)

### Source Files vs Generated Files

**Never edit files in `/docs/` directly** - they're auto-generated.

- **Edit:** Files in `/activities/`, `/handouts/`, `/content/`, `/instructor-materials/`
- **Render:** Run `./scripts/render-all.sh`
- **Output:** Appears in `/docs/`

## Troubleshooting

### Render script fails
- Check Quarto is installed: `quarto --version`
- Ensure you're in the project root directory
- Run: `./scripts/render-all.sh` (note: script is now in scripts/ folder)
- Check .qmd files have valid YAML headers

### Website links broken
- Re-run render script: `./scripts/render-all.sh`
- Check file names match links in `docs/index.html`
- Verify files were generated in `docs/` folders

### Cards missing from docs/
- Check source file exists in `/activities/materials/`
- Re-run render script
- Check for errors in Quarto YAML headers
- Verify file naming (lowercase, no prefixes)

### Instructor portal not loading
- Check `docs/instructor.html` exists
- Verify password: `instructor2025`
- Clear browser cache and try again

### RetailFlow internal portal not loading
- Check password: `pilot2024`
- Verify `retailflow-site/internal.html` exists
- Clear browser cache
