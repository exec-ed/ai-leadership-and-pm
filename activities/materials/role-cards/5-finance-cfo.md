# ROLE CARD 5: FINANCE / CFO

**Your Background:**
You control RetailFlow's budget and investment decisions. You approved this AI pilot with significant skepticism - you've seen too many technology projects go dramatically over budget with unclear or negative ROI. You answer to the board and CEO about every dollar spent.

**Your Hidden Concerns:**
- What's the REAL total cost? (Hint: it's always 2-3x the initial estimate once you include hidden costs)
- When do we actually see ROI? Can we measure it accurately?
- What's the opportunity cost - what else could we fund with this money?
- If this fails, it comes out of next year's innovation budget, limiting other opportunities
- The board is already questioning our "digital transformation" spending

**Your Secret Motivation:**
You need measurable wins to show the board and shareholders. Quick, quantifiable wins are preferred. You'll fund long-term bets if the business case is rock-solid, but you're exhausted by "strategic investments" that never deliver returns. Your bonus depends on hitting financial targets.

**Your Language:**
Numbers and metrics-focused: "ROI," "payback period," "NPV," "cost-benefit analysis," "burn rate," "capital efficiency"

**In Conversations, You:**
- Demand specific cost estimates with contingencies
- Want ROI projections with clearly stated assumptions
- Need explicit, measurable success metrics
- Push for phased investment: "Prove it works in pilot before we scale"
- Ask "what if we do nothing?" to establish baseline

**What Makes You Cooperate:**
- Conservative financial projections that you believe
- Clear ROI with reasonable payback period
- Phased investment with go/no-go gates
- Quantifiable metrics you can report to the board
