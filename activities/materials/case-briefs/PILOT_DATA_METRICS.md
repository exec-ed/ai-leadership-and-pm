---

## KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **AI Accuracy** | ≥90% | 88% | ⚠️ Close but below | Improved from 85% week 1. Data scientist estimates can hit 92% in 4 more weeks. |

## QUERY TYPE BREAKDOWN (Week 6)

| Query Type | % of Volume | AI Accuracy | Customer Satisfaction | Escalations |
|------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Order Status/Tracking** | 25% | 94% | 85% | 1.2% |
| **Returns/Refunds Policy** | 20% | 91% | 84% | 1.8% |
| **Product Care & Sizing** | 30% | 78% | 78% | 6.5% |
| **Website/App Technical** | 10% | 85% | 80% | 2.1% |
| **Complaints/Escalations** | 5% | N/A (not AI) | N/A | N/A |
| **Other** | 10% | 87% | 81% | 2.4% |

**Key Insight:** AI performs best on order tracking (94%) and worst on product care/sizing (78%). This is expected—product care requires nuance and expertise.

## COST ANALYSIS

| Component | Week 1 | Week 6 | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| **AI Platform Costs** | $2,500 | $2,500 | Fixed monthly licensing |
| **Labor Cost (human agents)** | $4,200 | $3,800 | Slight reduction due to AI handling 30% of queries |
| **Support/Maintenance** | $200 | $400 | Increased monitoring and model updates |
| **Total Weekly Cost** | $6,900 | $6,700 | |
| **Cost per Query (avg)** | $18 | $14 | Down from $18, but not at $12 target |

**Projection:** At 60% AI coverage, estimated cost per query: $11.50 (below $12 target)

## CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURVEY RESULTS

**Survey Size:** 500 customers who interacted with AI (Week 5-6)
**Response Rate:** 68% (340 responses)

### Overall Satisfaction
- **Very Satisfied (9-10):** 42%

## TEAM FEEDBACK (Customer Service Staff)

**Survey Size:** 5 customer service agents
**Feedback Method:** Weekly 1-on-1 check-ins

### Usage Patterns
- **Agent 1 (Sarah):** Uses AI 95% of routine queries (converted from skeptic)
- **Agent 2:** Uses AI 80% when available
- **Agent 3:** Uses AI 70% (still learning)
- **Agent 4:** Uses AI 60% (prefers manual approach)
- **Agent 5:** Uses AI 40% (hasn't fully adopted)

### Sentiment
- "AI handles the boring stuff. I focus on real problems." (Agent 1)
- "Some accuracy issues, but mostly good." (Agent 2)
- "Would use more if accuracy was higher." (Agent 4)
- "Still worried about my job security." (Agent 5)
- "Process works, but needs tweaking." (Agent 3)

### Team Concerns
- 2 agents still express job security concerns
- 1 agent struggles with timing of AI routing
- All agree: AI should NOT handle complaints or exceptions
- All note: Product care questions need human expertise

## LEADERSHIP FEEDBACK

### CEO (VP of Operations)
> "Good progress on response times. Still want to see accuracy at 90% before we scale. Cost savings are below projections. If we can get accuracy up and volume up, this scales. Otherwise, we pivot or kill."

**Priority:** Accuracy + ROI visibility

---

### CFO (Finance)
> "Cost per query is $14 vs. $12 target. At current scale, we're not seeing ROI. Need to get to 60%+ AI coverage to see meaningful savings. Budget is on track so far."

**Priority:** Cost efficiency, scale to profitability

---

### Data Scientist
> "Accuracy bottleneck is product care/sizing queries (78% vs. other types at 90%+). With 4 more weeks of model refinement and additional product data, I can get to 92% overall. After that, we can confidently scale."

**Priority:** Model quality, technical feasibility

---

### Customer Service Manager
> "Team is engaged. Initial resistance from Sarah is resolved. Adoption steady at 75%. If accuracy improves, I think the remaining agents will fully adopt. No blockers from operations side."

**Priority:** Team adoption, smooth operations

---

## INCIDENT SUMMARY

| Week | Incident | Status | Resolution |
|------|----------|--------|------------|
| **Week 1** | Data quality issue (wrong tracking numbers) | RESOLVED | Paused AI, retrained with clean data |
| **Week 2** | Team resistance (Sarah, 3 agents) | RESOLVED | Engaged Sarah, included in feedback process |
| **Week 3** | Escalation spike (4.5%) | RESOLVED | Normalized after agents learned AI limits |
| **Week 4-6** | Stable operations | ONGOING | No major incidents |

**Key Learning:** Issues in weeks 1-3 were solvable. Current state is stable and improving.

| "AI can work in customer service" | Yes (82% satisfaction) | ✓ **VALIDATED** | Proof of concept proven |
| "Accuracy will reach 90%" | Yes (at 88%) | ⚠️ **NOT YET** | Close—4 weeks to target |
| "Team will adopt it" | Yes (75% adoption) | ✓ **VALIDATED** | Solid adoption despite early resistance |
| "Response time will improve" | Yes (3.5 hours) | ✓ **VALIDATED** | Significant improvement proven |
| "Cost per query will drop to $12" | Yes (at $14) | ⚠️ **NOT YET** | Close—will hit target at scale |
| "Complaints/exceptions will still need humans" | Yes (not using AI) | ✓ **VALIDATED** | Correct assumption—AI can't handle |

## WHAT THIS DATA TELLS US

### Strengths
- ✓ AI works: 82% satisfaction proves value exists
- ✓ Speed: 3.5-hour response beats 26-hour baseline
- ✓ Team engaged: 75% adoption is solid for new tech
- ✓ Stable: Weeks 4-6 show no major issues

### Challenges
- ⚠️ Accuracy gap: 2 points from target (fixable with more training)
- ⚠️ Escalation rate: 3.5% vs. <2% target (but stabilized)
- ⚠️ Cost not optimized yet: Need higher AI volume to hit $12 target
- ⚠️ Product care accuracy low: 78% (but this is hard—maybe out of scope?)

### Clear Next Steps
- Data scientist: 4 more weeks of model refinement → 92% accuracy
- Operations: Add Phase 2 scope (return policy) → increase AI volume
- Leadership: Assess at week 10 with better data
