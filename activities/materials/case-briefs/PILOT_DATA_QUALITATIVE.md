# PILOT DATA: QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK
## RetailFlow AI Customer Service Pilot - Week 6 Summary

---

## CUSTOMER INTERVIEWS & SURVEY RESPONSES

### Customer Response Samples (Week 5-6)

**Customer #1: Positive Experience**
> "I asked where my order was and got a response in 2 minutes. The tracking number was correct. Way better than waiting 24 hours for an email. If it's always this fast, I'm happy."
>
> Satisfaction: 9/10

---

**Customer #2: Mixed Experience**
> "The AI answered my return policy question, but then gave me conflicting information about sizing. I had to escalate to a human who clarified. Why would AI try to answer something it doesn't understand?"
>
> Satisfaction: 6/10

---

**Customer #3: Positive**
> "Honestly expected this to be worse. AI got my order status right, and when I had a follow-up question, it escalated me to a human pretty quickly. Better than the old system where I'd wait forever."
>
> Satisfaction: 8/10

---

**Customer #4: Negative**
> "AI told me my return had been processed when it actually hadn't. I had to call back twice. This is exactly why I don't trust AI. I want to talk to a real person."
>
> Satisfaction: 3/10

---

**Customer #5: Positive**
> "I got an instant answer to a standard question. Didn't need more help. This is perfect for what it is."
>
> Satisfaction: 10/10

---

**Customer #6: Mixed**
> "The AI couldn't understand that I wanted a specific size recommendation based on my body type. It just gave generic sizing. A human would have asked follow-up questions. I still like the speed though."
>
> Satisfaction: 7/10

## TEAM FEEDBACK (Detailed Notes)

### Agent 1 (Sarah, Star Agent - 8 Years Tenure)

**Week 1-2 Sentiment:** Resistant ("AI can't do what we do")

**Week 3-4 Sentiment:** Shifting ("Actually, it does handle the routine stuff")

**Week 5-6 Sentiment:** Converted ("I use it for 95% of routine queries now")

**Quote:**
> "I was wrong about this. AI isn't replacing me—it's freeing me up. I'm now handling the customers with real problems, not answering 'where's my order' for the 50th time. This is actually better. I want accuracy to improve so I can trust it more, but this works."

**What Changed:** Direct conversation with PM, being included in feedback process, seeing data on what AI actually does well

---

### Agent 2 (Mid-Tenure, Early Adopter)

**Usage:** 80% of routine queries

**Quote:**
> "I like it. It's fast. Some accuracy issues, but mostly good. I just wish the escalation process was smoother—when I have to take over for the customer, it takes me a minute to understand the context."

**Feedback:** Process improvement (context passing)

---

### Agent 3 (New to Team, Learning)

**Usage:** 70% of routine queries

**Quote:**
> "I'm still learning when to use it and when not to use it. The product care questions are tricky. But for order tracking, it's solid. I'll probably use it more as I get more comfortable."

**Feedback:** More training needed on scope/boundaries

---

### Agent 4 (Prefers Manual)

**Usage:** 60% of routine queries

**Quote:**
> "I can see why people like it, but I'm faster doing it manually. Maybe I'm old school. If accuracy was higher, I'd probably trust it more and use it more."

**Feedback:** Needs to see accuracy improve to fully adopt

---

### Agent 5 (Holdout, Still Skeptical)

**Usage:** 40% of routine queries

**Quote:**
> "I still don't trust it completely. What if it gives a customer wrong information and then they blame me? Also... I've been doing this job 5 years. Will I still have a job in 2 years?"

**Feedback:** Job security concerns need to be addressed. Accuracy improvement might help.

---

### Team Consensus
> "AI should handle routine queries (order tracking, policy questions). It should NOT handle complaints, exceptions, or product care questions. Those need human expertise."

**Team Recommendation:**
"Expand AI carefully. Only to query types where accuracy is consistently 90%+. Keep humans for complex stuff."

---

## LEADERSHIP PERSPECTIVE (Extended Interviews)

### CEO (VP of Operations)

**Overall Assessment:**
> "This is promising. Response times are great. Customer satisfaction is up. But I'm not ready to scale yet."

**Key Concerns:**
- Accuracy at 88% is below my 90% threshold
- Cost savings aren't as high as projected
- I need to see this work for 4 more weeks before I commit to full rollout

**What Would Change CEO's Mind:**
- Accuracy hits 90%+
- Cost per query hits $12 or better
- Team fully adopts (not just 75%)
- No new crises in weeks 7-10

**Timeline Preference:**
> "If accuracy improves in 4 weeks, I want to scale by Week 10. But I'm not forcing it. Data should drive the decision."

---

### CFO (Finance)

**Budget Status:**
- Projected: $150K for 6-week pilot
- Actual: $140K (under budget so far)
- Cost per query: $14 (target: $12)

**ROI Calculation:**
> "Right now, this costs MORE than it saves because we're not at scale. But projections show: at 60% AI coverage, we save $180K annually. At 100%, we save $400K annually. That's the case for scaling. But we need to GET to 60% first."

**What Would Trigger CFO Approval:**
- Accuracy ≥90% (fewer errors, lower support costs)
- Ability to expand to 60%+ volume
- Clear path to $400K annual savings

---

### Data Scientist

**Technical Assessment:**
> "The model is solid. Accuracy is 88% because we're training on limited data (6 weeks of queries). With 4 more weeks of data + model refinement, I'm confident I can get to 92%."

**What's Holding Accuracy Back:**
- Product care questions (sizing, care instructions) need more training data
- Rare exception cases (damaged goods, special requests) harder to classify
- Misspellings in customer queries throw off classification

**4-Week Plan:**
- Collect 2 weeks more query data
- Retrain model on expanded dataset
- Fine-tune for product care queries specifically
- Test on holdout dataset
- Deploy refined model Week 10

**Risk Assessment:**
> "I'm 80% confident I can hit 92%. There's a 15% chance we get to 91% (still good). 5% chance we hit a wall at 89% (need to revisit approach)."

---

### Customer Service Manager

**Operational Status:**
> "Everything is running smoothly. Sarah's adoption is helping the rest of the team. No operational blockers."

**Team Capacity for Scale:**
- Current team (5 agents) handles 100% of 2,500 queries/week
- With 30% AI coverage, team handles 1,750 queries/week (each agent more focused, higher quality)
- At 60% AI coverage, team would handle 1,000 queries/week
- At 100% AI coverage, team would handle ~300 queries/week (exceptions only)

**What Team Needs for Scale:**
- Accuracy improvement (less rework)
- Clear scope (which query types AI handles)
- Training on escalation process
- Job security clarity ("You're not being replaced, you're shifting to harder work")

**Team Recommendation:**
> "We're ready to scale. My team understands the AI now. We trust it for routine queries. Just improve accuracy and we're good."

## CUSTOMER SUPPORT QUALITY METRICS

### Escalation Analysis

**Why customers escalate from AI to human:**

| Reason | Count | % | Example |
|--------|-------|----|---------|
| AI gave wrong info | 45 | 35% | Wrong tracking number |
| AI couldn't understand question | 35 | 27% | Specific sizing request |
| Customer asked for human | 25 | 19% | "I want to talk to someone" |
| AI offered multiple options | 15 | 11% | "Which option is right for me?" |
| System error | 10 | 8% | AI crashed, escalated to human |

**Insight:** 35% of escalations are actual errors (fixable with better training). 27% are scope limitations (product care). 19% are customer preference (can't fix). 11% are edge cases (fixable). 8% are technical issues (rare).

---

### Quality Issues Logged

**Week 1-2 (Crisis Period):**
- Multiple wrong tracking numbers
- Outdated return policy info
- Conflicting product information

**Week 3-4 (Stabilization):**
- Occasional misspelling confusion
- Sizing questions misinterpreted
- Rare wrong policy edge cases

**Week 5-6 (Stable):**
- Minimal errors
- Mostly scope limitations (can't answer product care)
- No major quality incidents

**Trend:** Quality improving, errors decreasing, remaining issues are mostly scope (not fixable with model improvement alone).

---

## QUALITATIVE THEMES

### What's Working Well
1. **Speed** - Most valued by customers
2. **Routine queries** - AI excels at order tracking, policy info
3. **Team adoption** - 75% is solid, improving
4. **Escalation process** - Works when needed
5. **Stability** - No crashes, reliable after Week 1

### What Needs Improvement
1. **Accuracy** - 88% is close but not 90%
2. **Product care** - AI struggles with nuance
3. **Error messaging** - Sometimes confuses customers
4. **Escalation context** - Humans struggle to pick up where AI left off
5. **Job security messaging** - 2 agents still worried

### What's Out of Scope
1. **Complaints** - Need human empathy
2. **Exceptions** - Need human judgment
3. **Complex questions** - Need human expertise
4. **Upset customers** - Need human reassurance

## KEY INSIGHTS

### For Executives
> "This works. Customers like the speed. Team is adopting. We just need 4 more weeks to prove accuracy, then we can scale with confidence."

### For Data Science
> "Accuracy is a solvable problem with more data and training time. You've proven the concept. Focus on product care queries for next iteration."

### For Operations
> "Team is ready. No operational blockers. Make sure accuracy improves before scaling, but your side is good."

### For Product
> "You're right about scope. Stick to routine queries. Avoid exceptions, complaints, and product expertise questions. That's where accuracy breaks."
