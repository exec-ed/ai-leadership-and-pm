# The 6 Frameworks in Leadership-PM Masterclass

Quick reference for what frameworks you're teaching and where they appear.

---

## 1. Stakeholder Management Framework

**What:** Power-Interest Matrix + 6 key stakeholder roles

**Practiced:** Exercise 1 - Stakeholder Speed Dating (10:05-10:50 AM)
**Handout:** `handouts/stakeholder-mapping-template.md`

**Key concepts:**
- Power-Interest Matrix (map stakeholders)
- 6 roles: Data Scientist, Operations, End User, IT Security, Finance, Executive
- Engagement strategies for each type

---

## 2. Pilot Design Framework (Goldilocks Principle)

**What:** Not too big, not too small - scope AI pilots correctly
**When taught:** Slides 11-15 (11:05-11:25 AM)
**Practiced:** Exercise 2 - Pilot Scoping (11:25-12:25 PM)
**Materials:** `activities/materials/case-briefs/pilot_scoping_case.md`

**Key concepts:**
- Goldilocks principle (right-sized scope)
- Success metrics definition
- Constraint management (budget/timeline)

---

## 3. Crisis Response Framework

**What:** 4-step process for handling AI project crises
**When taught:** Slides 17-18 (1:15-1:25 PM)
**Practiced:** Exercise 3 - Crisis Simulation (1:25-2:45 PM, 4 crises)
**Materials:** `activities/materials/case-briefs/crisis_sim_overview.md`

**Key concepts:**
- Diagnose → Decide → Communicate → Document
- 4 crisis types: Technical, People, Leadership, Ethical

---

## 4. Ethical Decision-Making Framework

**What:** 4 questions to guide ethical dilemmas
**When taught:** During Exercise 3, Crisis 4 - Ethical Dilemma (2:25-2:45 PM)
**Practiced:** Exercise 3, Crisis 4 (AI bias scenario)
**Handout:** `handouts/ethical-decision-framework.md` ← **NEWLY CREATED**

**The 4 questions:**
1. Who benefits?
2. What could go wrong?
3. How do we know it's working?
4. When do we stop?

---

## 5. Scale/Pivot/Kill Framework

**What:** Decision criteria for what to do after a pilot
**When taught:** Slides 19-20 (3:00-3:10 PM)
**Practiced:** Exercise 4 - Scale or Kill (3:10-3:50 PM, 3 case studies)
**Handouts:**
- `handouts/scale-pivot-kill-criteria.md` ← **RENAMED** (was ethical-decision-framework.md)
- `handouts/scale-pivot-kill-matrix.md` (case studies)

**Key concepts:**
- **Scale:** When ROI clear, tech works, stakeholders support
- **Pivot:** When direction needs adjustment
- **Kill:** When project should stop (not failure!)
- Decision criteria: Financial, Technical, Organizational, Customer, Strategic

---

## 6. Change Management Framework

**What:** Principles for managing resistance and adoption
**When taught:** Woven throughout all exercises
**Practiced:** All exercises (implicitly)
**Handout:** None - embedded in other frameworks

**Key concepts:**
- Expect resistance (it's normal)
- Involve stakeholders early
- Communicate constantly
- Navigate the change curve

## Framework-to-File Mapping

### Slides (content/slides-deck.md)
- Slides 1-5: Welcome & context
- Slides 6-10: **Framework 1** (Stakeholder Management)
- Slides 11-15: **Framework 2** (Pilot Design)
- Slide 16: RetailFlow setup
- Slides 17-18: **Framework 3** (Crisis Response)
- Slides 19-20: **Framework 5** (Scale/Pivot/Kill)
- Slides 21-23: Synthesis of all frameworks

### Handouts (what participants take home)
1. `stakeholder-mapping-template.md` - Framework 1
2. `ethical-decision-framework.md` - Framework 4 (NEWLY CREATED)
3. `scale-pivot-kill-criteria.md` - Framework 5 (RENAMED)
4. `scale-pivot-kill-matrix.md` - Framework 5 case studies
5. `company-overview.md` - RetailFlow context (reference)

### Materials (for exercises)
- `activities/materials/role-cards/` - Framework 1 exercise
- `activities/materials/constraint-cards/` - Framework 2 exercise
- `activities/materials/case-briefs/` - Frameworks 2 & 3 exercises

## What Changed (Just Now)

✅ **Fixed:** Renamed `ethical-decision-framework.md` → `scale-pivot-kill-criteria.md` (it was misnamed)
✅ **Created:** NEW `ethical-decision-framework.md` with the 4 questions
✅ **Now:** All handouts correctly named and frameworks are complete

- [ ] Handout exists? YES (stakeholder-mapping-template.md)

**Framework 2 (Pilot):**
- [ ] Slides teach it? YES (Slides 11-15)
- [ ] Exercise practices it? YES (Exercise 2)
- [ ] Handout exists? Embedded in materials

**Framework 3 (Crisis):**
- [ ] Slides teach it? YES (Slides 17-18)
- [ ] Exercise practices it? YES (Exercise 3)
- [ ] Handout exists? Embedded in crisis briefs

**Framework 4 (Ethics):**
- [ ] Slides teach it? IMPLICIT (in Crisis 4)
- [ ] Exercise practices it? YES (Crisis 4)
- [ ] Handout exists? YES (ethical-decision-framework.md) ← NOW YES!

**Framework 5 (Scale/Pivot/Kill):**
- [ ] Slides teach it? YES (Slides 19-20)

## For Delivery

When participants ask "What frameworks did we learn today?", your answer:

**"You learned 6 frameworks for AI project leadership:**

1. **Stakeholder Management** - Power-Interest Matrix
2. **Pilot Design** - Goldilocks Principle
3. **Crisis Response** - Diagnose, Decide, Communicate, Document
4. **Ethical Decision-Making** - 4 Questions
5. **Scale/Pivot/Kill** - Decision criteria
6. **Change Management** - Principles woven throughout
