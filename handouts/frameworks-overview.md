# Decision Frameworks

## Tools for Leading AI Projects

When you're managing an AI project or navigating a crisis, you need frameworks to think clearly and make good decisions. This section provides concise, practical guides to the most important decision-making frameworks used in the masterclass.

## Two Core Frameworks

### **1. Scale, Pivot, or Kill?**

When you've finished a pilot and need to decide what's next.

**The question:** Do you expand the project, change direction, or stop it?

**When to use:** End of pilot phase; deciding on next steps.

**Time to decide:** 10-15 minutes

**Quick summary:**
- **SCALE** if most criteria are met and there are no fundamental gaps
- **PIVOT** if core value is proven but gaps are solvable
- **KILL** if fundamental problems exist and the approach doesn't work

### **2. Crisis Response (DDCD)**

When something goes wrong and you need to lead your way through it.

**The question:** What do I do when faced with a crisis?

**When to use:** Technical failures, team resistance, executive pressure, unexpected problems.

**Time to apply:** 30 minutes total (5 min diagnose, 5 min decide, 15 min communicate, 5 min document)

**Quick summary:**
- **DIAGNOSE:** Understand the problem
- **DECIDE:** Choose your response
- **COMMUNICATE:** Tell the right people in the right order
- **DOCUMENT:** Record what you learned

## Three Crisis Scenarios

Each shows how DDCD applies to different types of crises:

### **Crisis #1: Data Quality Disaster**
*When your system gives wrong answers*

Your AI system launches but suddenly gives customers wrong information due to corrupted training data. You have 30 minutes to decide.

**Key lesson:** Technical crises need fast diagnosis and clear decisions. Data quality > model sophistication.

---

### **Crisis #2: Team Resistance**
*When your team doesn't trust the system*

Your star team member (with influence over others) actively discourages people from using the new AI system. You have 30 minutes to handle it.

**Key lesson:** Stated objections often mask real fears. Listening and involvement beat announcements. People leadership ≠ technical fixes.

---

### **Crisis #3: Executive Pressure**
*When your boss wants faster than is safe*

The CEO demands you expand the project 4 weeks faster than is realistic. You need to respond without just saying "no."

**Key lesson:** Understanding leadership pressure leads to better proposals. Data + empathy > refusal.

## How These Frameworks Connect

1. **Plan your pilot** using the foundations from the masterclass
2. **Run your pilot** using the Crisis Response framework when issues emerge
3. **Evaluate your results** using the Scale/Pivot/Kill framework
4. **Learn from crises** by documenting what happened

The frameworks build on each other. Your criteria from planning become your decision anchor in Scale/Pivot/Kill. The crises you navigate using DDCD teach you how to lead under pressure.

## Using These Frameworks with Your Team

**For pilots/projects:**
- Use Scale/Pivot/Kill at the decision point (end of pilot)
- Share the framework with your team so everyone understands how decisions will be made
- Make the decision criteria transparent upfront (in planning)

**For crises:**
- Walk your team through DDCD step-by-step
- Make the thinking visible (don't just announce decisions)
- Use the crises as teaching moments

**For documentation:**
- Document your decisions using these frameworks
- Future leaders will thank you for the clarity
- Your team learns from how you apply the frameworks

---

## Key Principles Across All Frameworks

✓ **Data beats gut feel**
Use evidence. Make it visible. Compare to your criteria.

✓ **Different problems need different solutions**
Technical crisis ≠ people crisis ≠ leadership crisis

✓ **Involve the right people**
Before announcing decisions, consult with those affected.

✓ **Make trade-offs visible**
Every option gives up something. Be honest about what.

✓ **Document for learning**
Future leaders on your team will face similar decisions. Help them.

## When in Doubt

Ask yourself:
- **Do I understand what's actually happening?** (DIAGNOSE)
- **Have I considered multiple options?** (DECIDE)
- **Have I told the right people in the right order?** (COMMUNICATE)
- **Will I learn from this?** (DOCUMENT)

If you can answer yes to all four, you're leading well.

## A Note on Simplicity

These frameworks are intentionally concise. Each can be applied in 10-30 minutes. They're designed for real projects where you don't have weeks to make decisions.

If you want more detail on facilitation, evidence-gathering, or team conversations, those are available in the instructor materials. But for participants and practitioners, these simplified versions capture the essence: **Clear thinking under pressure.**
