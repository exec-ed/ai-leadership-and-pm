# Crisis Response Framework

## How to Lead When Things Go Wrong

A crisis can be technical (system failure), people-focused (team resistance), or leadership-focused (executive pressure). This framework helps you respond quickly and effectively.

## The Four Steps: DDCD

When a crisis hits, follow this sequence:

### **1. DIAGNOSE (5-10 minutes)**

**Get facts, not interpretations.**

- What actually happened? (Not what it means—what happened?)
- How big is the problem? (How many people/systems affected?)
- What caused it? (Root cause analysis)
- Who needs to know?

**Bad diagnosis:** "The AI is broken."
**Good diagnosis:** "AI accuracy dropped to 75% due to corrupted training data affecting 30% of customer queries over the past 5 days."

**When you're done:** You understand the problem clearly enough to decide.

---

### **2. DECIDE (5-15 minutes)**

**Identify your options and choose one.**

- What are all possible ways to respond? (Brainstorm at least 3)
- What's the trade-off for each? (Speed vs. safety? Cost vs. quality?)
- Which option best addresses the root cause?

**Don't aim for perfect.** Aim for the best available option right now.

**Common options across crisis types:**
- **Pause & Fix:** Stop the system, fix the issue, restart
- **Continue with Controls:** Keep running but add safety measures
- **Hybrid Approach:** Blend speed and safety
- **Escalate/Kill:** Stop the project entirely

**When you're done:** You've made a clear decision and can explain the trade-off you're accepting.

---

### **3. COMMUNICATE (10-30 minutes)**

**Tell the right people, in the right order, with the right message.**

The order matters: **Team → Leadership → Customers**

**To your team:**
- Tell them what happened (facts)
- Tell them what you're doing about it
- Tell them what you need from them

**To leadership:**
- Brief them immediately (don't let them hear from someone else)
- Explain the impact and your plan
- Frame as "we found this early" (not "we failed")

**To customers (if affected):**
- Acknowledge the issue
- Explain what you're doing
- Show you're in control

**When you're done:** Everyone knows what's happening and what to expect.

---

### **4. DOCUMENT (5-10 minutes)**

**Write it down so you learn and others can learn from it.**

Record:
- What happened and when
- What the root cause was
- What decision you made and why
- What the outcome was (fill in later)
- **What you'll do differently next time**

**This isn't busywork.** Future leaders on your team will face similar crises. Your documentation helps them.

## Three Types of Crises: Different Approaches

While DDCD is the framework for all crises, how you apply it changes:

### **Technical Crisis** (System failure, data corruption, etc.)
- **Diagnose:** Find the technical problem
- **Decide:** Choose the technical fix
- **Communicate:** Announce the fix and timeline
- **Timeline:** Hours to days
- **Example:** Data quality issue in AI system

### **People Crisis** (Team resistance, morale, trust)
- **Diagnose:** Find the real fear (not the stated objection)
- **Decide:** Choose an engagement approach
- **Communicate:** Have conversations, not announcements
- **Timeline:** Days to weeks
- **Example:** Team member fears job loss due to automation

### **Leadership Crisis** (Executive pressure, scope creep, resources)
- **Diagnose:** Find the pressure behind the demand
- **Decide:** Propose alternatives that address the real need
- **Communicate:** Manage up with data and proposals
- **Timeline:** Days
- **Example:** CEO demands faster timeline than is safe

## Key Principles

**During DIAGNOSE:**
- Separate emotion from fact
- Measure the scope (is this big or small?)
- Find the root cause (not the symptom)

**During DECIDE:**
- Don't aim for perfect—aim for best available
- Make trade-offs visible and conscious
- Choose the option that addresses root cause

**During COMMUNICATE:**
- Different audiences need different messages
- Order matters: internal first, external second
- Always explain the "why"

**During DOCUMENT:**
- Focus on what you'll do differently next time
- Make it real for future leaders
- Connect the decision to learning

## Common Crisis Mistakes

❌ **Reacting without thinking**
*"The customer complained, so we immediately changed everything."*
**Better:** Diagnose first, then decide.

❌ **Hiding the problem**
*"We'll just fix it quietly and hope no one notices."*
**Better:** Tell leadership immediately. Surprises destroy trust.

❌ **Announcing without planning**
*"Everyone needs to know about this crisis."*
**Better:** Have a plan before you communicate.

❌ **Making it personal**
*"Sarah is resisting because she's difficult."*
**Better:** Ask what Sarah is actually afraid of.

❌ **Forgetting to document**
*"We fixed it, let's move on."*
**Better:** Document what you learned so next time is easier.

## Quick Decision Aid

**When you're in crisis, ask yourself:**

1. Do I understand what actually happened? (DIAGNOSE)
2. Do I have 2-3 options I could choose? (DECIDE)
3. Have I told the right people in the right order? (COMMUNICATE)
4. Will I write down what I learned? (DOCUMENT)

If you answered yes to all four, you're leading through crisis effectively.

## Remember

- **Crises are opportunities to show leadership**
- **Data and clarity beat speed**
- **Different crises need different approaches**
- **Your team looks to you to be calm and decisive**
- **What you do in a crisis defines your leadership**

**The goal isn't to prevent all crises.** The goal is to navigate them with clarity, integrity, and learning.
