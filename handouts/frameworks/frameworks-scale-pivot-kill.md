# Scale, Pivot, or Kill?

## A Simple Framework for Project Decisions

When you're running a pilot or testing a new idea, eventually you hit a moment of truth: **Do you expand it, change it, or stop it?**

This framework helps you make that decision based on data, not emotion.

## The Three Paths

### **SCALE** ‚úì
**What it means:** Roll out the project to full scope. It's working. Go big.

**When to choose:**
- You're hitting most of your success criteria
- Gaps are minor and don't undermine the core value
- Team is engaged and ready
- You have confidence this works at scale

**Example:** "Accuracy hit 91%, satisfaction is 83%, team adoption is 80%. The small gaps are worth the value we're delivering. Scale it."

---

### **PIVOT** üîÑ
**What it means:** Keep going, but change direction. Refine the scope, fix gaps, or adjust the approach.

**When to choose:**
- Core value is proven, but something needs improvement
- Gaps are solvable (not fundamental failures)
- You need more data before scaling
- Time and resources are available

**Example:** "Accuracy is 88% vs. 90% target. That's solvable‚Äî4 more weeks of model retraining will get us there. PIVOT: Extend 4 weeks, then reassess for scale."

---

### **KILL** ‚úó
**What it means:** Stop the project. The approach isn't working. Move on.

**When to choose:**
- The core idea doesn't work (not fixable gaps)
- You've proven the assumption wrong
- The cost to continue exceeds the value
- Better alternatives exist

**Example:** "Customers rejected the approach. We built for speed but they want personalization. A different approach is needed. KILL this version and start over."

## How to Decide: The 3-Step Process

### **Step 1: Score Your Criteria** (5 minutes)

Look at your **Go/No-Go criteria from planning**. For each one, did you hit the target?

| Criteria | Target | Actual | Hit? |
|----------|--------|--------|------|
| Accuracy | ‚â•90% | 88% | ‚ùå |
| Satisfaction | ‚â•80% | 82% | ‚úì |
| Response Time | <4 hrs | 3.5 hrs | ‚úì |
| Cost per Query | $12 | $14 | ‚ùå |
| Team Adoption | 80% | 75% | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Escalations | <2% | 3.5% | ‚ùå |

**Count the checkmarks.** If you hit 4+ of 6, you're in SCALE/PIVOT territory. If you hit 2-3, you're in PIVOT territory. If you hit <2, you're in KILL territory.

---

### **Step 2: Solvable vs. Fundamental** (5 minutes)

Look at the gaps. Are they **solvable** (need more time/resources) or **fundamental** (the approach doesn't work)?

**Solvable gaps:**
- "Accuracy is 88% vs. 90%‚Äîthat's a 2-point gap we can close with more training"
- "Team adoption is low‚Äîthey just need more exposure"
- "Cost is higher than expected‚Äîwe can optimize once we hit scale"

**Fundamental gaps:**
- "Customers hate this approach"
- "The core technology doesn't work for this use case"
- "We can't get the data we need"

**If all gaps are solvable:** You can SCALE or PIVOT.
**If some gaps are fundamental:** You PIVOT or KILL.

---

### **Step 3: Make Your Call** (5 minutes)

Based on steps 1-2, decide:

- **SCALE** if: Most criteria met + no fundamental gaps + team ready
- **PIVOT** if: Some criteria met + gaps are solvable + you have time
- **KILL** if: Few criteria met + fundamental gaps + better alternatives exist

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Sunk Cost Fallacy**
*"We spent $150K, so we have to scale it."*
**Reality:** That money is gone. Only future value matters.

‚ùå **Cherry-Picking Data**
*"Customers are happy, so ignore the accuracy gap."*
**Reality:** All criteria matter. You can't ignore metrics that fail.

‚ùå **Confusing "Not Perfect" with "Broken"*
*"We're 2 points away from target, so we must kill it."*
**Reality:** Small gaps = PIVOT, not KILL.

‚ùå **Making Emotional Decisions**
*"I feel like this could work..."*
**Reality:** Use your criteria. Data beats gut feel.

## The Decision Template

Use this to document your call:

**Decision:** [SCALE / PIVOT / KILL]

**Criteria Met:** [List how many of your success criteria you hit]

**Why?** [2-3 sentences explaining your logic]

**Trade-offs:** [What are you giving up?]

**Next Steps:** [If SCALE: rollout plan. If PIVOT: what changes? If KILL: what's next?]

## Remember

- Your Go/No-Go criteria from the planning phase are your anchor
- Data beats emotion
- "Not perfect yet" is not the same as "doesn't work"
- You can decide with imperfect information
- Most projects PIVOT‚Äîthat's normal and healthy

**The goal isn't to make the perfect decision. It's to make the best decision you can with the data you have.**
